<p t="19350" d="5800">Professor: In today's
lecture I want</p>
<p t="25150" d="2565">to develop several
more formulas that</p>
<p t="27715" d="4695">will allow us to reach our goal
of differentiating everything.</p>
<p t="32410" d="9390">So these are
derivative formulas,</p>
<p t="41800" d="3760">and they come in two flavors.</p>
<p t="45560" d="6510">The first kind is
specific, so some specific</p>
<p t="52070" d="3390">function we're giving
the derivative of.</p>
<p t="55460" d="5280">And that would be, for
example, x^n or (1/x) .</p>
<p t="60740" d="4480">Those are the ones that we
did a couple of lectures ago.</p>
<p t="65220" d="5290">And then there are
general formulas,</p>
<p t="70510" d="1890">and the general
ones don't actually</p>
<p t="72400" d="2420">give you a formula for
a specific function</p>
<p t="74820" d="3930">but tell you something like,
if you take two functions</p>
<p t="78750" d="2090">and add them together,
their derivative</p>
<p t="80840" d="2630">is the sum of the derivatives.</p>
<p t="83470" d="3750">Or if you multiply by a
constant, for example,</p>
<p t="87220" d="4270">so c times u, the
derivative of that</p>
<p t="91490" d="7500">is c times u' where
c is constant.</p>
<p t="98990" d="2640">All right, so these
kinds of formulas</p>
<p t="101630" d="4440">are very useful, both the
specific and the general kind.</p>
<p t="106070" d="17560">For example, we need both
kinds for polynomials.</p>
<p t="123630" d="2125">And more generally, pretty
much any set of formulas</p>
<p t="125755" d="1958">that we give you, will
give you a few functions</p>
<p t="127713" d="1467">to start out with
and then you'll</p>
<p t="129180" d="7300">be able to generate lots more
by these general formulas.</p>
<p t="136480" d="4520">So today, we wanna concentrate
on the trig functions,</p>
<p t="141000" d="6570">and so we'll start out with
some specific formulas.</p>
<p t="147570" d="2010">And they're going
to be the formulas</p>
<p t="149580" d="3420">for the derivative
of the sine function</p>
<p t="153000" d="4910">and the cosine function.</p>
<p t="157910" d="3330">So that's what we'll spend the
first part of the lecture on,</p>
<p t="161240" d="5270">and at the same time I hope to
get you very used to dealing</p>
<p t="166510" d="2620">with trig functions,
although that's something</p>
<p t="169130" d="6500">that you should think
of as a gradual process.</p>
<p t="175630" d="2680">Alright, so in order
to calculate these,</p>
<p t="178310" d="5410">I'm gonna start over here and
just start the calculation.</p>
<p t="183720" d="1550">So here we go.</p>
<p t="185270" d="2840">Let's check what happens
with the sine function.</p>
<p t="188110" d="7480">So, I take sin (x + delta
x), I subtract sin x</p>
<p t="195590" d="6500">and I divide by delta x.</p>
<p t="202090" d="2180">Right, so this is the
difference quotient</p>
<p t="204270" d="2580">and eventually I'm gonna have
to take the limit as delta</p>
<p t="206850" d="2470">x goes to 0.</p>
<p t="209320" d="2530">And there's really
only one thing</p>
<p t="211850" d="4980">we can do with this to
simplify or change it,</p>
<p t="216830" d="5610">and that is to use the sum
formula for the sine function.</p>
<p t="222440" d="1120">So, that's this.</p>
<p t="223560" d="5120">That's sin x cos delta x plus--</p>
<p t="234490" d="1580">Oh, that's not what it is?</p>
<p t="236070" d="4970">OK, so what is it?
sin x sin delta x.</p>
<p t="241040" d="1900">OK, good.</p>
<p t="242940" d="4560">Plus cosine.</p>
<p t="247500" d="1790">No?</p>
<p t="249290" d="1270">Oh, OK.</p>
<p t="250560" d="3910">So which is it?</p>
<p t="254470" d="1706">OK.</p>
<p t="256176" d="1124">Alright, let's take a vote.</p>
<p t="257300" d="2720">Is it sine, sine, or
is it sine, cosine?</p>
<p t="260020" d="2560">Audience: [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p t="262580" d="8520">Professor: OK, so is this
going to be... cosine.</p>
<p t="271100" d="3350">All right, you better remember
these formulas, alright?</p>
<p t="274450" d="2841">OK, turns out that
it's sine, cosine.</p>
<p t="277291" d="499">All right.</p>
<p t="277790" d="1850">Cosine, sine.</p>
<p t="279640" d="7670">So here we go, no gotta
do x here, sin (delta x).</p>
<p t="287310" d="3790">Alright, so now there's lots
of places to get confused here,</p>
<p t="291100" d="4060">and you're gonna need to
make sure you get it right.</p>
<p t="295160" d="4070">Alright, so we're gonna put
those in parentheses here.</p>
<p t="299230" d="11080">sin (a + b) is sin a
cos b plus cos a sin b.</p>
<p t="310310" d="2430">All right, now that's
what I did over here,</p>
<p t="312740" d="8690">except the letter x was a,
and the letter b was delta x.</p>
<p t="321430" d="2130">Now that's just the first part.</p>
<p t="323560" d="3420">That's just this part
of the expression.</p>
<p t="326980" d="2154">I still have to remember
the minus sin x.</p>
<p t="329134" d="916">That comes at the end.</p>
<p t="330050" d="2070">Minus sin x.</p>
<p t="332120" d="5780">And then, I have to remember the
denominator, which is delta x.</p>
<p t="337900" d="5140">OK?</p>
<p t="343040" d="4210">Alright, so now...</p>
<p t="347250" d="2460">The next thing we're
gonna do is we're</p>
<p t="349710" d="2570">gonna try to group the terms.</p>
<p t="352280" d="5870">And the difficulty with all such
arguments is the following one:</p>
<p t="358150" d="3910">any tricky limit is
basically 0 / 0 when</p>
<p t="362060" d="1140">you set delta x equal to 0.</p>
<p t="363200" d="3280">If I set delta x equal to
0, this is sin x - sin x.</p>
<p t="366480" d="2040">So it's a 0 / 0 term.</p>
<p t="368520" d="1520">Here we have
various things which</p>
<p t="370040" d="2130">are 0 and various things
which are non-zero.</p>
<p t="372170" d="5551">We must group the terms so
that a 0 stays over a 0.</p>
<p t="377721" d="1499">Otherwise, we're
gonna have no hope.</p>
<p t="379220" d="2770">If we get some 1 / 0
term, we'll get something</p>
<p t="381990" d="2170">meaningless in the limit.</p>
<p t="384160" d="3630">So I claim that the right
thing to do here is to notice,</p>
<p t="387790" d="3840">and I'll just point
out this one thing.</p>
<p t="391630" d="3950">When delta x goes to 0,
this cosine of 0 is 1.</p>
<p t="395580" d="4050">So it doesn't cancel unless we
throw in this extra sine term</p>
<p t="399630" d="500">here.</p>
<p t="400130" d="3490">So I'm going to use
this common factor,</p>
<p t="403620" d="1050">and combine those terms.</p>
<p t="404670" d="1810">So this is really
the only thing you're</p>
<p t="406480" d="2320">gonna have to check in this
particular calculation.</p>
<p t="408800" d="1960">So we have the
common factor of sin</p>
<p t="410760" d="3780">x, and that multiplies
something that will cancel,</p>
<p t="414540" d="4630">which is (cos delta
x - 1) / delta x.</p>
<p t="419170" d="4130">That's the first term,
and now what's left,</p>
<p t="423300" d="3170">well there's a cos
x that factors out,</p>
<p t="426470" d="7570">and then the other factor is
(sin delta x) / (delta x).</p>
<p t="434040" d="6810">OK, now does anyone
remember from last time what</p>
<p t="440850" d="4150">this thing goes to?</p>
<p t="445000" d="2580">How many people say 1?</p>
<p t="447580" d="1760">How many people say 0?</p>
<p t="449340" d="1840">All right, it's 0.</p>
<p t="451180" d="2360">That's my favorite
number, alright?</p>
<p t="453540" d="500">0.</p>
<p t="454040" d="2140">It's the easiest
number to deal with.</p>
<p t="456180" d="3020">So this goes to
0, and that's what</p>
<p t="459200" d="6780">happens as delta x tends to 0.</p>
<p t="465980" d="1170">How about this one?</p>
<p t="467150" d="4600">This one goes to 1, my second
favorite number, almost as</p>
<p t="471750" d="2600">easy to deal with as 0.</p>
<p t="474350" d="1930">And these things are
picked for a reason.</p>
<p t="476280" d="1750">They're the simplest
numbers to deal with.</p>
<p t="478030" d="8790">So altogether, this thing as
delta x goes to 0 goes to what?</p>
<p t="486820" d="2620">I want a single person to
answer, a brave volunteer.</p>
<p t="489440" d="890">Alright, back there.</p>
<p t="490330" d="1740">Student: Cosine</p>
<p t="492070" d="2580">Professor: Cosine,
because this factor is 0.</p>
<p t="494650" d="2910">It cancels and this factor
has a 1, so it's cosine.</p>
<p t="497560" d="2670">So it's cos x.</p>
<p t="500230" d="5610">So our conclusion over here
- and I'll put it in orange -</p>
<p t="505840" d="9080">is that the derivative of
the sine is the cosine.</p>
<p t="514920" d="3250">OK, now I still wanna label
these very important limit</p>
<p t="518170" d="1050">facts here.</p>
<p t="519220" d="2430">This one we'll call
A, and this one we're</p>
<p t="521650" d="2690">going to call B, because we
haven't checked them yet.</p>
<p t="524340" d="2000">I promised you I would
do that, and I'll</p>
<p t="526340" d="2120">have to do that this time.</p>
<p t="528460" d="4030">So we're relying on
those things being true.</p>
<p t="532490" d="3650">Now I'm gonna do the same
thing with the cosine function,</p>
<p t="536140" d="2590">except in order to do it I'm
gonna have to remember the sum</p>
<p t="538730" d="2200">rule for cosine.</p>
<p t="540930" d="2544">So we're gonna do almost
the same calculation here.</p>
<p t="543474" d="1666">We're gonna see that
that will work out,</p>
<p t="545140" d="7250">but now you have to remember
that cos (a + b) = cos cos,</p>
<p t="552390" d="2960">no it's not cosine^2, because
there are two different</p>
<p t="555350" d="1410">quantities here.</p>
<p t="556760" d="6890">It's cos a cos b - sin a sin b.</p>
<p t="563650" d="7630">All right, so you'll have
to be willing to call those</p>
<p t="571280" d="3520">forth at will right now.</p>
<p t="574800" d="1660">So let's do the cosine now.</p>
<p t="576460" d="9040">So that's cos (x + delta x)
- cos x divided by delta x.</p>
<p t="585500" d="2330">OK, there's the
difference quotient</p>
<p t="587830" d="1488">for the cosine function.</p>
<p t="589318" d="2458">And now I'm gonna do the same
thing I did before except I'm</p>
<p t="591776" d="1924">going to apply the
second rule, that</p>
<p t="593700" d="2070">is the sum rule for cosine.</p>
<p t="595770" d="7631">And that's gonna give me cos x
cos delta x - sin x sin delta</p>
<p t="603401" d="499">x.</p>
<p t="603900" d="5400">And I have to remember again
to subtract the cosine divided</p>
<p t="609300" d="2290">by this delta x.</p>
<p t="611590" d="4780">And now I'm going to regroup
just the way I did before,</p>
<p t="616370" d="5680">and I get the common factor of
cosine multiplying (cos delta x</p>
<p t="622050" d="3130">- 1) / delta x.</p>
<p t="625180" d="5730">And here I get the sin x
but actually it's -sin x.</p>
<p t="630910" d="5410">And then I have (sin
delta x) / delta x.</p>
<p t="636320" d="580">All right?</p>
<p t="636900" d="1670">The only difference
is this minus sign</p>
<p t="638570" d="4170">which I stuck inside there.</p>
<p t="642740" d="1500">Well that's not the
only difference,</p>
<p t="644240" d="4200">but it's a crucial difference.</p>
<p t="648440" d="6260">OK, again by A we get that this
is 0 as delta x tends to 0.</p>
<p t="654700" d="1670">And this is 1.</p>
<p t="656370" d="3220">Those are the properties
I called A and B.</p>
<p t="659590" d="5250">And so the result here
as delta x tends to 0</p>
<p t="664840" d="3630">is that we get negative sin x.</p>
<p t="668470" d="3330">That's the factor.</p>
<p t="671800" d="7080">So this guy is negative sin x.</p>
<p t="678880" d="5680">I'll put a little
box around that too.</p>
<p t="684560" d="4480">Alright, now these
formulas take a little bit</p>
<p t="689040" d="5180">of getting used
to, but before I do</p>
<p t="694220" d="4260">that I'm gonna explain to
you the proofs of A and B.</p>
<p t="698480" d="5990">So we'll get ourselves
started by mentioning that.</p>
<p t="704470" d="3100">Maybe before I do
that though, I want</p>
<p t="707570" d="4140">to show you how A and B fit into
the proofs of these theorems.</p>
<p t="711710" d="14320">So, let me just make
some remarks here.</p>
<p t="726030" d="2990">So this is just
a remark but it's</p>
<p t="729020" d="6580">meant to help you to frame
how these proofs worked.</p>
<p t="735600" d="2050">So, first of all,
I want to point out</p>
<p t="737650" d="2100">that if you take
the rate of change</p>
<p t="739750" d="8700">of sin x, no let's
start with cosine</p>
<p t="748450" d="2000">because a little
bit less obvious.</p>
<p t="750450" d="3370">If I take the rate of change
of cos x, so in other words</p>
<p t="753820" d="7360">this derivative at x =
0, then by definition</p>
<p t="761180" d="4120">this is a certain limit
as delta x goes to 0.</p>
<p t="765300" d="1560">So which one is it?</p>
<p t="766860" d="4310">Well I have to evaluate
cosine at 0 + delta</p>
<p t="771170" d="2220">x, but that's just delta x.</p>
<p t="773390" d="2850">And I have to
subtract cosine at 0.</p>
<p t="776240" d="3800">That's the base point,
but that's just 1.</p>
<p t="780040" d="3010">And then I have to
divide by delta x.</p>
<p t="783050" d="3800">And lo and behold you can see
that this is exactly the limit</p>
<p t="786850" d="1370">that we had over there.</p>
<p t="788220" d="7660">This is the one that we know is
0 by what we call property A.</p>
<p t="795880" d="7270">And similarly, if I take the
derivative of sin x at x=0,</p>
<p t="803150" d="3850">then that's going to be the
limit as delta x goes to 0</p>
<p t="807000" d="3700">of sin delta x / delta x.</p>
<p t="810700" d="4430">And that's because I should
be subtracting sine of 0</p>
<p t="815130" d="2741">but sine of 0 is 0.</p>
<p t="817871" d="499">Right?</p>
<p t="818370" d="10140">So this is going to be 1 by our
property B. And so the remark</p>
<p t="828510" d="2520">that I want to make,
in addition to this,</p>
<p t="831030" d="4170">is something about the
structure of these two proofs.</p>
<p t="835200" d="17790">Which is the derivatives
of sine and cosine at x = 0</p>
<p t="852990" d="12510">give all values of
d/dx sin x, d/dx cos x.</p>
<p t="865500" d="2130">So that's really what this
argument is showing us,</p>
<p t="867630" d="3790">is that we just need one
rate of change at one place</p>
<p t="871420" d="7350">and then we work out
all the rest of them.</p>
<p t="878770" d="2220">So that's really the
substance of this proof.</p>
<p t="880990" d="2580">That of course really then
shows that it boils down</p>
<p t="883570" d="4450">to showing what this rate of
change is in these two cases.</p>
<p t="888020" d="2710">So now there's enough
suspense that we</p>
<p t="890730" d="17280">want to make sure that we know
that those answers are correct.</p>
<p t="908010" d="4170">OK, so let's demonstrate
both of them.</p>
<p t="912180" d="6360">I'll start with B. I need to
figure out property B. Now,</p>
<p t="918540" d="3930">we only have one alternative
as to a type of proof</p>
<p t="922470" d="2240">that we can give of
this kind of result,</p>
<p t="924710" d="4360">and that's because we only
have one way of describing</p>
<p t="929070" d="3470">sine and cosine functions,
that is geometrically.</p>
<p t="932540" d="10080">So we have to give
a geometric proof.</p>
<p t="942620" d="2570">And to write down
a geometric proof</p>
<p t="945190" d="1960">we are going to have
to draw a picture.</p>
<p t="947150" d="2400">And the first step
in the proof, really,</p>
<p t="949550" d="2200">is to replace this
variable delta</p>
<p t="951750" d="4050">x which is going to 0
with another name which</p>
<p t="955800" d="2570">is suggestive of what we're
gonna do which is the letter</p>
<p t="958370" d="2580">theta for an angle.</p>
<p t="960950" d="2610">OK, so let's draw
a picture of what</p>
<p t="963560" d="2390">it is that we're going to do.</p>
<p t="965950" d="2030">Here is the circle.</p>
<p t="967980" d="2760">And here is the origin.</p>
<p t="970740" d="3160">And here's some little
angle, well I'll</p>
<p t="973900" d="2210">draw it a little
larger so it's visible.</p>
<p t="976110" d="3320">Here's theta, alright?</p>
<p t="979430" d="1580">And this is the unit circle.</p>
<p t="981010" d="4900">I won't write that down on here
but that's the unit circle.</p>
<p t="985910" d="3870">And now sin theta is this
vertical distance here.</p>
<p t="989780" d="2960">Maybe, I'll draw it
in a different color</p>
<p t="992740" d="2010">so that we can see it all.</p>
<p t="994750" d="3650">OK so here's this distance.</p>
<p t="998400" d="7420">This distance is sin theta.</p>
<p t="1005820" d="2540">OK?</p>
<p t="1008360" d="3080">Now almost the
only other thing we</p>
<p t="1011440" d="3330">have to write down in this
picture to have it work out</p>
<p t="1014770" d="3730">is that we have to recognize
that when theta is the angle,</p>
<p t="1018500" d="4779">that's also the arc length
of this piece of the circle</p>
<p t="1023279" d="1041">when measured in radians.</p>
<p t="1024320" d="9376">So this length here is
also arc length theta.</p>
<p t="1033696" d="1124">That little piece in there.</p>
<p t="1034820" d="3760">So maybe I'll use a different
color for that to indicate it.</p>
<p t="1038580" d="6980">So that's orange and that's
this little chunk there.</p>
<p t="1045560" d="1310">So those are the two pieces.</p>
<p t="1046870" d="9380">Now in order to persuade
you now that the limit is</p>
<p t="1056250" d="1714">what it's supposed
to be, I'm going</p>
<p t="1057964" d="1666">to extend the picture
just a little bit.</p>
<p t="1059630" d="2800">I'm going to double it, just
for my own linguistic sake</p>
<p t="1062430" d="1810">and so that I can
tell you a story.</p>
<p t="1064240" d="2450">Alright, so that
you'll remember this.</p>
<p t="1066690" d="2950">So I'm going to take
a theta angle below</p>
<p t="1069640" d="4030">and I'll have another copy
of sin theta down here.</p>
<p t="1073670" d="7120">And now the total
picture is really</p>
<p t="1080790" d="3931">like a bow and its
bow string there.</p>
<p t="1084721" d="499">Alright?</p>
<p t="1085220" d="5830">So what we have here is
a length of 2 sin theta.</p>
<p t="1091050" d="2580">So maybe I'll write it
this way, 2 sin theta.</p>
<p t="1093630" d="1490">I just doubled it.</p>
<p t="1095120" d="10520">And here I have underneath,
whoops, I got it backwards.</p>
<p t="1105640" d="1400">Sorry about that.</p>
<p t="1107040" d="2104">Trying to be fancy
with the colored chalk</p>
<p t="1109144" d="1166">and I have it reversed here.</p>
<p t="1110310" d="1870">So this is not 2 sin theta.</p>
<p t="1112180" d="1360">2 sin theta is the vertical.</p>
<p t="1113540" d="1370">That's the green.</p>
<p t="1114910" d="2260">So let's try that again.</p>
<p t="1117170" d="4020">This is 2 sin theta, alright?</p>
<p t="1121190" d="3260">And then in the denominator
I have the arc length</p>
<p t="1124450" d="6230">which is theta is the first half
and so double it is 2 theta.</p>
<p t="1130680" d="630">Alright?</p>
<p t="1131310" d="5320">So if you like, this is
the bow and up here we</p>
<p t="1136630" d="7660">have the bow string.</p>
<p t="1144290" d="3450">And of course we
can cancel the 2's.</p>
<p t="1147740" d="3510">That's equal to
sin theta / theta.</p>
<p t="1151250" d="6650">And so now why does this
tend to 1 as theta goes to 0?</p>
<p t="1157900" d="5770">Well, it's because as the
angle theta gets very small,</p>
<p t="1163670" d="5210">this curved piece looks more
and more like a straight one.</p>
<p t="1168880" d="760">Alright?</p>
<p t="1169640" d="2990">And if you get very, very
close here the green segment</p>
<p t="1172630" d="1980">and the orange segment
would just merge.</p>
<p t="1174610" d="2240">They would be practically
on top of each other.</p>
<p t="1176850" d="5510">And they have closer and closer
and closer to the same length.</p>
<p t="1182360" d="9430">So that's why this is true.</p>
<p t="1191790" d="11410">I guess I'll articulate that
by saying that short curves are</p>
<p t="1203200" d="3350">nearly straight.</p>
<p t="1206550" d="3450">Alright, so that's the
principle that we're using.</p>
<p t="1210000" d="8970">Or short pieces of curves, if
you like, are nearly straight.</p>
<p t="1218970" d="4670">So if you like, this
is the principle.</p>
<p t="1223640" d="7210">So short pieces of curves.</p>
<p t="1230850" d="690">Alright?</p>
<p t="1231540" d="7850">So now I also need to
give you a proof of A.</p>
<p t="1239390" d="4600">And that has to do with
this cosine function here.</p>
<p t="1243990" d="7915">This is the property
A. So I'm going</p>
<p t="1251905" d="1582">to do this by
flipping it around,</p>
<p t="1253487" d="2583">because it turns out that this
numerator is a negative number.</p>
<p t="1256070" d="1990">If I want to interpret
it as a length,</p>
<p t="1258060" d="2280">I'm gonna want a
positive quantity.</p>
<p t="1260340" d="3840">So I'm gonna write
down 1 - cos theta here</p>
<p t="1264180" d="4140">and then I'm gonna
divide by theta there.</p>
<p t="1268320" d="2400">Again I'm gonna make some
kind of interpretation.</p>
<p t="1270720" d="4410">Now this time I'm going to draw
the same sort of bow and arrow</p>
<p t="1275130" d="3840">arrangement, but maybe I'll
exaggerate it a little bit.</p>
<p t="1278970" d="4220">So here's the vertex
of the sector,</p>
<p t="1283190" d="8590">but we'll maybe make
it a little longer.</p>
<p t="1291780" d="3810">Alright, so here it is, and
here was that middle line</p>
<p t="1295590" d="2720">which was the unit-- Whoops.</p>
<p t="1298310" d="2570">OK, I think I'm going
to have to tilt it up.</p>
<p t="1300880" d="6120">OK, let's try from here.</p>
<p t="1307000" d="4570">Alright, well you know
on your pencil and paper</p>
<p t="1311570" d="2240">it will look better than
it does on my blackboard.</p>
<p t="1313810" d="1380">OK, so here we are.</p>
<p t="1315190" d="1580">Here's this shape.</p>
<p t="1316770" d="4660">Now this angle is
supposed to be theta</p>
<p t="1321430" d="1920">and this angle is another theta.</p>
<p t="1323350" d="2545">So here we have a length
which is again theta</p>
<p t="1325895" d="2015">and another length which
is theta over here.</p>
<p t="1327910" d="1760">That's the same as
in the other picture,</p>
<p t="1329670" d="3620">except we've
exaggerated a bit here.</p>
<p t="1333290" d="1720">And now we have
this vertical line,</p>
<p t="1335010" d="3230">which again I'm gonna draw
in green, the bow string.</p>
<p t="1338240" d="6580">But notice that as the vertex
gets farther and farther away,</p>
<p t="1344820" d="2199">the curved line gets
closer and closer</p>
<p t="1347019" d="1041">to being a vertical line.</p>
<p t="1348060" d="2610">That's sort of the flip
side, by expansion,</p>
<p t="1350670" d="2440">of the zoom in principle.</p>
<p t="1353110" d="2020">The principle that
curves are nearly</p>
<p t="1355130" d="1820">straight when you zoom in.</p>
<p t="1356950" d="2420">If you zoom out that would
mean sending this vertex way,</p>
<p t="1359370" d="2830">way out somewhere.</p>
<p t="1362200" d="2170">The curved line, the
piece of the circle,</p>
<p t="1364370" d="4200">gets more and more straight.</p>
<p t="1368570" d="5060">And now let me show you
where this numerator 1 - cos</p>
<p t="1373630" d="3990">theta is on this picture.</p>
<p t="1377620" d="3420">So where is it?</p>
<p t="1381040" d="2640">Well, this whole distance is 1.</p>
<p t="1383680" d="3930">But the distance from
the vertex to the green</p>
<p t="1387610" d="2260">is cosine of theta.</p>
<p t="1389870" d="2560">Right, because this is
theta, so dropping down</p>
<p t="1392430" d="4400">the perpendicular this
distance back to the origin</p>
<p t="1396830" d="800">is cos theta.</p>
<p t="1397630" d="3260">So this little
tiny, bitty segment</p>
<p t="1400890" d="5650">here is basically the
gap between the curve</p>
<p t="1406540" d="2280">and the vertical segment.</p>
<p t="1408820" d="7000">So the gap is equal
to 1 - cos theta.</p>
<p t="1415820" d="4820">So now you can see that as
this point gets farther away,</p>
<p t="1420640" d="3030">if this got sent off
to the Stata Center,</p>
<p t="1423670" d="2170">you would hardly be able
to tell the difference.</p>
<p t="1425840" d="2280">The bow string would
coincide with the bow</p>
<p t="1428120" d="2360">and this little gap
between the bow string</p>
<p t="1430480" d="1950">and the bow would
be tending to 0.</p>
<p t="1432430" d="1852">And that's the
statement that this</p>
<p t="1434282" d="4258">tends to 0 as theta tends to 0.</p>
<p t="1438540" d="1590">The scaled version of that.</p>
<p t="1440130" d="1120">Yeah, question down here.</p>
<p t="1441250" d="3550">Student: Doesn't the denominator
also tend to 0 though?</p>
<p t="1444800" d="5390">Professor: Ah, the question is
"doesn't the denominator also</p>
<p t="1450190" d="1480">tend to 0?"</p>
<p t="1451670" d="2840">And the answer is yes.</p>
<p t="1454510" d="4150">In my strange analogy with
zooming in, what I did</p>
<p t="1458660" d="1730">was I zoomed out the picture.</p>
<p t="1460390" d="5060">So in other words, if you
imagine you're taking this</p>
<p t="1465450" d="2759">and you're putting it under
a microscope over here</p>
<p t="1468209" d="1541">and you're looking
at something where</p>
<p t="1469750" d="2160">theta is getting smaller
and smaller and smaller</p>
<p t="1471910" d="1430">and smaller.</p>
<p t="1473340" d="1030">Alright?</p>
<p t="1474370" d="5130">But now because I want my
picture, I expanded my picture.</p>
<p t="1479500" d="3460">So the ratio is the
thing that's preserved.</p>
<p t="1482960" d="7510">So if I make it so that
this gap is tiny...</p>
<p t="1490470" d="1940">Let me say this one more time.</p>
<p t="1492410" d="4620">I'm afraid I've made life
complicated for myself.</p>
<p t="1497030" d="4010">If I simply let this
theta tend in to 0,</p>
<p t="1501040" d="3004">that would be the same
effect as making this</p>
<p t="1504044" d="2416">closer and closer in and then
the vertical would approach.</p>
<p t="1506460" d="2580">But I want to keep on
blowing up the picture</p>
<p t="1509040" d="2900">so that I can see the
difference between the vertical</p>
<p t="1511940" d="1320">and the curve.</p>
<p t="1513260" d="3220">So that's very much like if
you are on a video screen</p>
<p t="1516480" d="2260">and you zoom in, zoom
in, zoom in, and zoom in.</p>
<p t="1518740" d="1875">So the question is what
would that look like?</p>
<p t="1520615" d="2735">That has the same effect
as sending this point out</p>
<p t="1523350" d="4490">farther and farther in that
direction, to the left.</p>
<p t="1527840" d="1590">And so I'm just
trying to visualize it</p>
<p t="1529430" d="2980">for you by leaving the
theta at this scale,</p>
<p t="1532410" d="1680">but actually the
scale of the picture</p>
<p t="1534090" d="2200">is then changing when I do that.</p>
<p t="1536290" d="3090">So theta is going
to 0, but I I'm</p>
<p t="1539380" d="3410">rescaling so that it's of a
size that we can look at it,</p>
<p t="1542790" d="3502">And then imagine
what's happening to it.</p>
<p t="1546292" d="1458">OK, does that answer
your question?</p>
<p t="1547750" d="2842">Student: My question
then is that seems</p>
<p t="1550592" d="3658">to prove that that
limit is equal to 0/0.</p>
<p t="1554250" d="7260">Professor: It proves more
than it is equal to 0/0.</p>
<p t="1561510" d="3415">It's the ratio of this little
short thing to this longer</p>
<p t="1564925" d="1165">thing.</p>
<p t="1566090" d="2830">And this is getting much, much
shorter than this total length.</p>
<p t="1568920" d="1070">You're absolutely
right that we're</p>
<p t="1569990" d="2583">comparing two quantities which
are going to 0, but one of them</p>
<p t="1572573" d="1784">is much smaller than the other.</p>
<p t="1574357" d="1833">In the other case we
compared two quantities</p>
<p t="1576190" d="1958">which were both going to
0 and they both end up</p>
<p t="1578148" d="1692">being about equal in length.</p>
<p t="1579840" d="3220">Here the previous one
was this green one.</p>
<p t="1583060" d="1940">Here it's this
little tiny bit here</p>
<p t="1585000" d="7840">and it's way shorter than
the 2 theta distance.</p>
<p t="1592840" d="1060">Yeah, another question.</p>
<p t="1593900" d="845">Student: cos theta - 1 over
cos theta is the same as 1-</p>
<p t="1594745" d="875">cos theta over theta?</p>
<p t="1595620" d="10120">Professor: cos theta - 1 over...</p>
<p t="1605740" d="4040">Student: [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p t="1609780" d="6910">Professor: So here, what I
wrote is (cos delta x - 1)</p>
<p t="1616690" d="4930">/ delta x, OK, and I
claimed that it goes to 0.</p>
<p t="1621620" d="10750">Here, I wrote minus that, that
is I replaced delta x by theta.</p>
<p t="1632370" d="10350">But then I wrote this thing.</p>
<p t="1642720" d="3830">So (cos theta - 1) minus
1 is the negative of this.</p>
<p t="1646550" d="1520">Alright?</p>
<p t="1648070" d="1440">And if I show that
this goes to 0,</p>
<p t="1649510" d="3652">it's the same as showing
the other one goes to 0.</p>
<p t="1653162" d="708">Another question?</p>
<p t="1653870" d="5180">Student: [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p t="1659050" d="3590">Professor: So the question
is, what about this business</p>
<p t="1662640" d="1580">about arc length.</p>
<p t="1664220" d="4390">So the word arc length,
that orange shape is an arc.</p>
<p t="1668610" d="2740">And we're just talking about
the length of that arc,</p>
<p t="1671350" d="1487">and so we're calling
it arc length.</p>
<p t="1672837" d="1583">That's what the word
arc length means,</p>
<p t="1674420" d="1500">it just means the
length of the arc.</p>
<p t="1675920" d="7700">Student: [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p t="1683620" d="2410">Professor: Why is
this length theta?</p>
<p t="1686030" d="2350">Ah, OK so this is a
very important point,</p>
<p t="1688380" d="3100">and in fact it's the very next
point that I wanted to make.</p>
<p t="1691480" d="3650">Namely, notice that
in this calculation</p>
<p t="1695130" d="4570">it was very important
that we used length.</p>
<p t="1699700" d="4440">And that means that the way
that we're measuring theta,</p>
<p t="1704140" d="8190">is in what are known as radians.</p>
<p t="1712330" d="4540">Right, so that applies to both B
and A, it's a scale change in A</p>
<p t="1716870" d="2600">and doesn't really matter
but in B it's very important.</p>
<p t="1719470" d="3510">The only way that
this orange length</p>
<p t="1722980" d="3160">is comparable to
this green length,</p>
<p t="1726140" d="2460">the vertical is
comparable to the arc,</p>
<p t="1728600" d="4920">is if we measure them in terms
of the same notion of length.</p>
<p t="1733520" d="2840">If we measure them in
degrees, for example,</p>
<p t="1736360" d="2530">it would be completely wrong.</p>
<p t="1738890" d="3830">We divide up the angles
into 360 degrees,</p>
<p t="1742720" d="1600">and that's the wrong
unit of measure.</p>
<p t="1744320" d="3670">The correct measure is the
length along the unit circle,</p>
<p t="1747990" d="1600">which is what radians are.</p>
<p t="1749590" d="11900">And so this is only
true if we use radians.</p>
<p t="1761490" d="12160">So again, a little warning
here, that this is in radians.</p>
<p t="1773650" d="7410">Now here x is in radians.</p>
<p t="1781060" d="4630">The formulas are just wrong
if you use other units.</p>
<p t="1785690" d="560">Ah yeah?</p>
<p t="1786250" d="9230">Student: [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p t="1795480" d="1810">Professor: OK so the
second question is why</p>
<p t="1797290" d="3340">is this crazy length here 1.</p>
<p t="1800630" d="7370">And the reason is
that the relationship</p>
<p t="1808000" d="3780">between this picture up here
and this picture down here,</p>
<p t="1811780" d="4370">is that I'm drawing
a different shape.</p>
<p t="1816150" d="2650">Namely, what I'm
really imagining here</p>
<p t="1818800" d="2660">is a much, much smaller theta.</p>
<p t="1821460" d="880">OK?</p>
<p t="1822340" d="3090">And then I'm blowing
that up in scale.</p>
<p t="1825430" d="2450">So this scale of this
picture down here</p>
<p t="1827880" d="3550">is very different from the
scale of the picture up there.</p>
<p t="1831430" d="3420">And if the angle is
very, very, very small</p>
<p t="1834850" d="2985">then one has to be
very, very long in order</p>
<p t="1837835" d="1595">for me to finish the circle.</p>
<p t="1839430" d="2390">So, in other words,
this length is 1</p>
<p t="1841820" d="2870">because that's what
I'm insisting on.</p>
<p t="1844690" d="3220">So, I'm claiming that that's
how I define this circle,</p>
<p t="1847910" d="4580">to be of unit radius.</p>
<p t="1852490" d="710">Another question?</p>
<p t="1853200" d="11994">Student: [INAUDIBLE]
the ratio between 1 -</p>
<p t="1865194" d="2166">cos theta and theta will
get closer and closer to 1.</p>
<p t="1867360" d="1291">I don't understand [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p t="1868651" d="12899">Professor: OK, so
the question is it's</p>
<p t="1881550" d="4260">hard to visualize
this fact here.</p>
<p t="1885810" d="5019">So let me, let me take you
through a couple of steps,</p>
<p t="1890829" d="2541">because I think probably other
people are also having trouble</p>
<p t="1893370" d="1560">with this visualization.</p>
<p t="1894930" d="1900">The first part of
the visualization I'm</p>
<p t="1896830" d="2740">gonna try to demonstrate
on this picture up here.</p>
<p t="1899570" d="1870">The first part of
the visualization</p>
<p t="1901440" d="3910">is that I should think
of a beak of a bird</p>
<p t="1905350" d="2530">closing down, getting
narrower and narrower.</p>
<p t="1907880" d="2550">So in other words,
the angle theta</p>
<p t="1910430" d="3620">has to be getting smaller
and smaller and smaller.</p>
<p t="1914050" d="1730">OK, that's the first step.</p>
<p t="1915780" d="2870">So that's the process
that we're talking about.</p>
<p t="1918650" d="5230">Now, in order to draw that, once
theta gets incredibly narrow,</p>
<p t="1923880" d="2570">in order to depict that I have
to blow the whole picture back</p>
<p t="1926450" d="1250">up in order be able to see it.</p>
<p t="1927700" d="1730">Otherwise it just
disappears on me.</p>
<p t="1929430" d="2660">In fact in the limit theta
= 0, it's meaningless.</p>
<p t="1932090" d="990">It's just a flat line.</p>
<p t="1933080" d="2420">That's the whole problem
with these tricky limits.</p>
<p t="1935500" d="2600">They're meaningless right
at the zero-zero level.</p>
<p t="1938100" d="3910">It's only just a little away
that they're actually useful,</p>
<p t="1942010" d="3880">that you get useful geometric
information out of them.</p>
<p t="1945890" d="1410">So we're just a little away.</p>
<p t="1947300" d="3860">So that's what this picture down
below in part A is meant to be.</p>
<p t="1951160" d="2975">It's supposed to be that theta
is open a tiny crack, just</p>
<p t="1954135" d="1026">a little bit.</p>
<p t="1955161" d="2124">And the smallest I can draw
it on the board for you</p>
<p t="1957285" d="2875">to visualize it is using the
whole length of the blackboard</p>
<p t="1960160" d="1230">here for that.</p>
<p t="1961390" d="2000">So I've opened a little
tiny bit and by the time</p>
<p t="1963390" d="1749">we get to the other
end of the blackboard,</p>
<p t="1965139" d="1371">of course it's fairly wide.</p>
<p t="1966510" d="3781">But this angle theta
is a very small angle.</p>
<p t="1970291" d="499">Alright?</p>
<p t="1970790" d="5880">So I'm trying to imagine what
happens as this collapses.</p>
<p t="1976670" d="3000">Now, when I imagine
that I have to imagine</p>
<p t="1979670" d="2520">a geometric interpretation
of both the numerator</p>
<p t="1982190" d="3830">and the denominator
of this quantity here.</p>
<p t="1986020" d="2280">And just see what happens.</p>
<p t="1988300" d="5720">Now I claimed the numerator is
this little tiny bit over here</p>
<p t="1994020" d="4984">and the denominator is actually
half of this whole length here.</p>
<p t="1999004" d="1416">But the factor of
2 doesn't matter</p>
<p t="2000420" d="3830">when you're seeing whether
something tends to 0 or not.</p>
<p t="2004250" d="740">Alright?</p>
<p t="2004990" d="1666">And I claimed that
if you stare at this,</p>
<p t="2006656" d="1804">it's clear that
this is much shorter</p>
<p t="2008460" d="4290">than that vertical curve there.</p>
<p t="2012750" d="2390">And I'm claiming, so this
is what you have to imagine,</p>
<p t="2015140" d="3680">is this as it gets smaller
and smaller and smaller still</p>
<p t="2018820" d="2770">that has the same effect of
this thing going way, way way,</p>
<p t="2021590" d="3920">farther away and this vertical
curve getting closer and closer</p>
<p t="2025510" d="1650">and closer to the green.</p>
<p t="2027160" d="5370">And so that the gap between
them gets tiny and goes to 0.</p>
<p t="2032530" d="910">Alright?</p>
<p t="2033440" d="3140">So not only does it go to
0, that's not enough for us,</p>
<p t="2036580" d="4960">but it also goes to 0 faster
than this theta goes to 0.</p>
<p t="2041540" d="3740">And I hope the evidence
is pretty strong here</p>
<p t="2045280" d="4940">because it's so tiny
already at this stage.</p>
<p t="2050220" d="2130">Alright.</p>
<p t="2052350" d="3790">We are going to move
forward and you'll</p>
<p t="2056140" d="2280">have to ponder these
things some other time.</p>
<p t="2058420" d="2220">So I'm gonna give you
an even harder thing</p>
<p t="2060640" d="5960">to visualize now so be prepared.</p>
<p t="2066600" d="9710">OK, so now, the next
thing that I'd like to do</p>
<p t="2076310" d="1390">is to give you a second proof.</p>
<p t="2077700" d="1730">Because it really
is important, I</p>
<p t="2079430" d="8220">think, to understand this
particular fact more thoroughly</p>
<p t="2087650" d="1660">and also to get
a lot of practice</p>
<p t="2089310" d="2140">with sines and cosines.</p>
<p t="2091450" d="4480">So I'm gonna give
you a geometric proof</p>
<p t="2095930" d="15080">of the formula for sine here,
for the derivative of sine.</p>
<p t="2111010" d="2410">So here we go.</p>
<p t="2113420" d="12860">This is a geometric
proof of this fact.</p>
<p t="2126280" d="3120">This is for all theta.</p>
<p t="2129400" d="3700">So far we only did
it for theta = 0</p>
<p t="2133100" d="3260">and now we're going to
do it for all theta.</p>
<p t="2136360" d="2570">So this is a different
proof, but it uses</p>
<p t="2138930" d="3490">exactly the same principles.</p>
<p t="2142420" d="2970">Right?</p>
<p t="2145390" d="5960">So, I want do this by
drawing another picture,</p>
<p t="2151350" d="3440">and the picture is
going to describe</p>
<p t="2154790" d="4580">y, which is sin
theta, which is if you</p>
<p t="2159370" d="22790">like the vertical position
of some circular motion.</p>
<p t="2182160" d="5010">So I'm imagining that something
is going around in a circle.</p>
<p t="2187170" d="3450">Some particle is going
around in a circle.</p>
<p t="2190620" d="5757">And so here's the
circle, here the origin.</p>
<p t="2196377" d="1083">This is the unit distance.</p>
<p t="2197460" d="6180">And right now it happens to
be at this location P. Maybe</p>
<p t="2203640" d="2520">we'll put P a little over here.</p>
<p t="2206160" d="4100">And here's the angle theta.</p>
<p t="2210260" d="1300">And now we're going to move it.</p>
<p t="2211560" d="2930">We're going to vary
theta and we're</p>
<p t="2214490" d="2430">interested in the
rate of change of y.</p>
<p t="2216920" d="3370">So y is the height
of P but we're</p>
<p t="2220290" d="1580">gonna move it to
another location.</p>
<p t="2221870" d="5530">We'll move it along
the circle to Q. Right?</p>
<p t="2227400" d="1800">So here it is.</p>
<p t="2229200" d="3160">Here's the thing.</p>
<p t="2232360" d="2090">So how far did we move it?</p>
<p t="2234450" d="4120">Well we moved it by
an angle delta theta.</p>
<p t="2238570" d="1970">So we started theta,
theta is going</p>
<p t="2240540" d="1773">to be fixed in this
argument, and we're</p>
<p t="2242313" d="1677">going to move a little
bit delta theta.</p>
<p t="2243990" d="2190">And now we're just
gonna try to figure out</p>
<p t="2246180" d="2330">how far the thing moved.</p>
<p t="2248510" d="1930">Well, in order to
do that we've got</p>
<p t="2250440" d="4150">to keep track of the height,
the vertical displacement here.</p>
<p t="2254590" d="3744">So we're going to draw
this right angle here, this</p>
<p t="2258334" d="4106">is the position R. And
then this distance here</p>
<p t="2262440" d="3060">is the change in y.</p>
<p t="2265500" d="500">Alright?</p>
<p t="2266000" d="4190">So the picture is
we have something</p>
<p t="2270190" d="1920">moving around a unit circle.</p>
<p t="2272110" d="1570">A point moving
around a unit circle.</p>
<p t="2273680" d="3955">It starts at P, it moves to
Q. It moves from angle theta</p>
<p t="2277635" d="1955">to angle theta plus delta theta.</p>
<p t="2279590" d="6180">And the issue is how
much does y move?</p>
<p t="2285770" d="1570">And the formula
for y is sin theta.</p>
<p t="2287340" d="22370">So that's telling us the
rate of change of sin theta.</p>
<p t="2309710" d="4790">Alright, well so let's just
try to think a little bit</p>
<p t="2314500" d="1480">about what this is.</p>
<p t="2315980" d="1756">So, first of all,
I've already said this</p>
<p t="2317736" d="1564">and I'm going to repeat it here.</p>
<p t="2319300" d="2350">Delta y is PR.</p>
<p t="2321650" d="2840">It's going from P and
going straight up to R.</p>
<p t="2324490" d="2590">That's how far y moves.</p>
<p t="2327080" d="2560">That's the change in y
That's what I said up</p>
<p t="2329640" d="3270">in the right hand corner there.</p>
<p t="2332910" d="560">Oops.</p>
<p t="2333470" d="2960">I said PR but I wrote PQ.</p>
<p t="2336430" d="2700">Alright, that's not a good idea.</p>
<p t="2339130" d="500">Alright.</p>
<p t="2339630" d="3460">So delta Y is PR.</p>
<p t="2343090" d="4070">And now I want to draw the
diagram again one time.</p>
<p t="2347160" d="8870">So here's Q, here's R,
and here's P, and here's</p>
<p t="2356030" d="1270">my triangle.</p>
<p t="2357300" d="7000">And now what I'd like to
do is draw this curve here</p>
<p t="2364300" d="2670">which is a piece of
the arc of the circle.</p>
<p t="2366970" d="2590">But really what I
want to keep in mind</p>
<p t="2369560" d="3740">is something that I did also
in all these other arguments.</p>
<p t="2373300" d="2030">Which is, maybe I
should have called</p>
<p t="2375330" d="2681">this orange, that I'm gonna
think of the straight line</p>
<p t="2378011" d="499">between.</p>
<p t="2378510" d="2655">So it's the straight line
approximation to the curve</p>
<p t="2381165" d="3844">that we're always interested in.</p>
<p t="2385009" d="1541">So the straight line
is much simpler,</p>
<p t="2386550" d="2060">because then we just
have a triangle here.</p>
<p t="2388610" d="3407">And in fact it's
a right triangle.</p>
<p t="2392017" d="2333">Right, so we have the geometry
of a right triangle which</p>
<p t="2394350" d="4860">is going to now let us do
all of our calculations.</p>
<p t="2399210" d="4430">OK, so now the key step
is this same principle</p>
<p t="2403640" d="3920">that we already used which is
that short pieces of curves</p>
<p t="2407560" d="1480">are nearly straight.</p>
<p t="2409040" d="2960">So that means that this piece
of the circular arc here from P</p>
<p t="2412000" d="5323">to Q is practically the same
as the straight segment from P</p>
<p t="2417323" d="6967">to Q. So, that's this
principle that - well,</p>
<p t="2424290" d="3290">let's put it over
here - Is that PQ</p>
<p t="2427580" d="5610">is practically the same as the
straight segment from P to Q.</p>
<p t="2433190" d="2630">So how are we going to use that?</p>
<p t="2435820" d="1930">We want to use
that quantitatively</p>
<p t="2437750" d="1330">in the following way.</p>
<p t="2439080" d="3270">What we want to notice is
that the distance from P to Q</p>
<p t="2442350" d="3770">is approximately delta theta.</p>
<p t="2446120" d="500">Right?</p>
<p t="2446620" d="2436">Because the arc length
along that curve,</p>
<p t="2449056" d="1624">the length of the
curve is delta theta.</p>
<p t="2450680" d="4370">So the length of the green which
is PQ is almost delta theta.</p>
<p t="2455050" d="6640">So this is essentially delta
theta, this distance here.</p>
<p t="2461690" d="3670">Now the second step, which
is a little trickier,</p>
<p t="2465360" d="3620">is that we have to work
out what this angle is.</p>
<p t="2468980" d="2660">So our goal, and I'm gonna put
it one step below because I'm</p>
<p t="2471640" d="2640">gonna put the geometric
reasoning in between,</p>
<p t="2474280" d="6700">is I need to figure out
what the angle QPR is.</p>
<p t="2480980" d="2360">If I can figure out
what this angle is,</p>
<p t="2483340" d="3290">then I'll be able to figure out
what this vertical distance is</p>
<p t="2486630" d="2210">because I'll know the
hypotenuse and I'll</p>
<p t="2488840" d="2060">know the angle so I'll be
able to figure out what</p>
<p t="2490900" d="5710">the side of the triangle is.</p>
<p t="2496610" d="3610">So now let me show you
why that's possible to do.</p>
<p t="2500220" d="3180">So in order to do that first of
all I'm gonna trade the boards</p>
<p t="2503400" d="7200">and show you where
the line PQ is.</p>
<p t="2510600" d="3770">So the line PQ is here.</p>
<p t="2514370" d="2100">That's the whole thing.</p>
<p t="2516470" d="3720">And the key point about this
line that I need you to realize</p>
<p t="2520190" d="4040">is that it's practically
perpendicular,</p>
<p t="2524230" d="4680">it's almost perpendicular,
to this ray here.</p>
<p t="2528910" d="640">Alright?</p>
<p t="2529550" d="2990">It's not quite because the
distance between P to Q</p>
<p t="2532540" d="722">is non-zero.</p>
<p t="2533262" d="1458">So it isn't quite,
but in the limit</p>
<p t="2534720" d="2350">it's going to be perpendicular.</p>
<p t="2537070" d="1030">Exactly perpendicular.</p>
<p t="2538100" d="2880">The tangent line to the circle.</p>
<p t="2540980" d="5840">So the key thing
that I'm going to use</p>
<p t="2546820" d="8311">is that PQ is almost
perpendicular to OP.</p>
<p t="2555131" d="499">Alright?</p>
<p t="2555630" d="2080">The ray from the
origin is basically</p>
<p t="2557710" d="2190">perpendicular to
that green line.</p>
<p t="2559900" d="2640">And then the second
thing I'm going to use</p>
<p t="2562540" d="10581">is something that's obvious
which is that PR is vertical.</p>
<p t="2573121" d="499">OK?</p>
<p t="2573620" d="4460">So those are the two pieces of
geometry that I need to see.</p>
<p t="2578080" d="4600">And now notice what's happening
upstairs on the picture here</p>
<p t="2582680" d="2370">in the upper right.</p>
<p t="2585050" d="4500">What I have is the
angle theta is the angle</p>
<p t="2589550" d="3360">between the horizontal and OP.</p>
<p t="2592910" d="1440">That's angle theta.</p>
<p t="2594350" d="3640">If I rotate it by ninety
degree, the horizontal</p>
<p t="2597990" d="890">becomes vertical.</p>
<p t="2598880" d="2850">It becomes PR and
the other thing</p>
<p t="2601730" d="3080">rotated by 90 degrees
becomes the green line.</p>
<p t="2604810" d="5270">So the angle that I'm talking
about I get by taking this guy</p>
<p t="2610080" d="2390">and rotating it by 90 degrees.</p>
<p t="2612470" d="1330">It's the same angle.</p>
<p t="2613800" d="4430">So that means that this angle
here is essentially theta.</p>
<p t="2618230" d="1650">That's what this angle is.</p>
<p t="2619880" d="1960">Let me repeat that
one more time.</p>
<p t="2621840" d="1450">We started out
with an angle that</p>
<p t="2623290" d="3250">looks like this, which is
the horizontal-- that's</p>
<p t="2626540" d="2060">the origin straight
out horizontally.</p>
<p t="2628600" d="1960">That's the thing labeled 1.</p>
<p t="2630560" d="4245">That distance there.</p>
<p t="2634805" d="1625">That's my right arm
which is down here.</p>
<p t="2636430" d="4750">My left arm is pointing up
and it's going from the origin</p>
<p t="2641180" d="5250">to the point P. So
here's the horizontal</p>
<p t="2646430" d="2940">and the angle between
them is theta.</p>
<p t="2649370" d="4560">And now, what I claim is that
if I rotate by 90 degrees up,</p>
<p t="2653930" d="2910">like this, without
changing anything -</p>
<p t="2656840" d="2020">so that was what I
did - the horizontal</p>
<p t="2658860" d="2300">will become a vertical.</p>
<p t="2661160" d="1830">That's PR.</p>
<p t="2662990" d="2040">That's going up, PR.</p>
<p t="2665030" d="7050">And if I rotate OP 90
degrees, that's exactly PQ.</p>
<p t="2672080" d="1460">OK?</p>
<p t="2673540" d="9020">So let me draw it
on there one time.</p>
<p t="2682560" d="2660">Let's do it with
some arrows here.</p>
<p t="2685220" d="4400">So I started out with
this and then, we'll</p>
<p t="2689620" d="6850">label this as orange,
OK so red to orange,</p>
<p t="2696470" d="5370">and then I rotate by
90 degrees and the red</p>
<p t="2701840" d="5220">becomes this starting from P
and the orange rotates around 90</p>
<p t="2707060" d="4310">degrees and becomes
this thing here.</p>
<p t="2711370" d="820">Alright?</p>
<p t="2712190" d="4062">So this angle here is
the same as the other one</p>
<p t="2716252" d="2208">which I've just drawn.</p>
<p t="2718460" d="8570">Different vertices
for the angles.</p>
<p t="2727030" d="1180">OK?</p>
<p t="2728210" d="2890">Well I didn't say
that all arguments</p>
<p t="2731100" d="5350">were supposed to be easy.</p>
<p t="2736450" d="1730">Alright, so I claim
that the conclusion</p>
<p t="2738180" d="5020">is that this angle is
approximately theta.</p>
<p t="2743200" d="2470">And now we can finish
our calculation,</p>
<p t="2745670" d="2630">because we have something with
the hypotenuse being delta</p>
<p t="2748300" d="5040">theta and the angle being theta
and so this segment here PR is</p>
<p t="2753340" d="3490">approximately the
hypotenuse length</p>
<p t="2756830" d="5600">times the cosine of the angle.</p>
<p t="2762430" d="3310">And that is exactly
what we wanted.</p>
<p t="2765740" d="5090">If we divide, we divide by
delta theta, we get (delta y)</p>
<p t="2770830" d="6200">/ (delta theta) is
approximately cos theta.</p>
<p t="2777030" d="3670">And that's the same thing as...</p>
<p t="2780700" d="1670">So what we want in
the limit is exactly</p>
<p t="2782370" d="2530">the delta theta going to 0
of (delta y) / (delta theta)</p>
<p t="2784900" d="3120">is equal to cos theta.</p>
<p t="2788020" d="4250">So we get an approximation on
a scale that we can visualize</p>
<p t="2792270" d="7320">and in the limit the
formula is exact.</p>
<p t="2799590" d="4470">OK, so that is a geometric
argument for the same result.</p>
<p t="2804060" d="3880">Namely that the derivative
of sine is cosine.</p>
<p t="2807940" d="500">Yeah?</p>
<p t="2808440" d="3150">Student: [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p t="2811590" d="2830">Professor: You will have to do
some kind of geometric proofs</p>
<p t="2814420" d="1420">sometimes.</p>
<p t="2815840" d="3890">When you'll really need
this is probably in 18.02.</p>
<p t="2819730" d="3290">So you'll need to make
reasoning like this.</p>
<p t="2823020" d="2710">This is, for example, the
way that you actually develop</p>
<p t="2825730" d="2470">the theory of arc length.</p>
<p t="2828200" d="5050">Dealing with delta x's and
delta y's is a common tool.</p>
<p t="2833250" d="4560">Alright, I have one
more thing that I</p>
<p t="2837810" d="7260">want to talk about today,
which is some general rules.</p>
<p t="2845070" d="3160">We took a little bit more time
than I expected with this.</p>
<p t="2848230" d="3550">So what I'm gonna do is
just tell you the rules</p>
<p t="2851780" d="4550">and we'll discuss
them in a few days.</p>
<p t="2856330" d="13850">So let me tell you
the general rules.</p>
<p t="2870180" d="9990">So these were the specific ones
and here are some general ones.</p>
<p t="2880170" d="8320">So the first one is
called the product rule.</p>
<p t="2888490" d="2520">And what it says is that if
you take the product of two</p>
<p t="2891010" d="2620">functions and
differentiate them,</p>
<p t="2893630" d="4550">you get the derivative of
one times the other plus</p>
<p t="2898180" d="3880">the other times the
derivative of the one.</p>
<p t="2902060" d="2290">Now the way that you
should remember this,</p>
<p t="2904350" d="3620">and the way that I'll
carry out the proof,</p>
<p t="2907970" d="12040">is that you should think of it
is you change one at a time.</p>
<p t="2920010" d="4070">And this is a very useful way of
thinking about differentiation</p>
<p t="2924080" d="2450">when you have
things which depend</p>
<p t="2926530" d="3130">on more than one function.</p>
<p t="2929660" d="4090">So this is a general procedure.</p>
<p t="2933750" d="5300">The second formula that
I wanted to mention</p>
<p t="2939050" d="8420">is called the quotient rule
and that says the following.</p>
<p t="2947470" d="5750">That (u / v) prime
has a formula as well.</p>
<p t="2953220" d="8060">And the formula is
(u'v - uv' ) / v^2.</p>
<p t="2961280" d="1960">So this is our second formula.</p>
<p t="2963240" d="8120">Let me just mention, both of
them are extremely valuable</p>
<p t="2971360" d="1810">and you'll use
them all the time.</p>
<p t="2973170" d="10430">This one of course only
works when v is not 0.</p>
<p t="2983600" d="3326">Alright, so because
we're out of time</p>
<p t="2986926" d="1374">we're not gonna
prove these today</p>
<p t="2988300" d="2208">but we'll prove these next
time and you're definitely</p>
<p t="2990508" d="3252">going to be responsible
for these kinds of proofs.</p>
