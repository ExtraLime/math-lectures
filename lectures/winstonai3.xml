<p t="9330" d="1640">PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
Ladies and gentlemen, the</p>
<p t="10970" d="2700">engineers drinking song.</p>
<p t="13670" d="2639">Back in the day, I've drunk
quite a lot to that song.</p>
<p t="16309" d="4111">And as drinking songs
go, it's not bad.</p>
<p t="20420" d="3840">I caution you, however, before
playing this song in the</p>
<p t="24260" d="3980">presence of small children,
audition it first.</p>
<p t="28240" d="4220">Some of the verses are
sufficiently gross as to make</p>
<p t="32460" d="4670">a sailor go beyond blushing.</p>
<p t="37130" d="2250">It's an interesting song because
there are an infinite</p>
<p t="39380" d="2200">number of verses.</p>
<p t="41580" d="2260">Here's the mathematical proof.</p>
<p t="43840" d="3080">Suppose there were a finite
number of verses.</p>
<p t="46920" d="2160">Then there would be
a last verse.</p>
<p t="49080" d="3460">And if there were a last verse,
then some drunk alumni</p>
<p t="52540" d="2030">would compose a new one.</p>
<p t="54570" d="3830">Therefore, there is no last
verse, the size is not finite,</p>
<p t="58400" d="4030">and there are an infinite
number of verses.</p>
<p t="62430" d="3180">I play it for you today because
I'm an engineer.</p>
<p t="65610" d="1726">I like to build stuff.</p>
<p t="67336" d="1674">I build stuff out of wood.</p>
<p t="69010" d="1800">I build stuff out of metal.</p>
<p t="70810" d="2020">I build stuff out of rocks.</p>
<p t="72830" d="3640">And I especially like
to write programs.</p>
<p t="76470" d="3710">I don't know, sometimes people
come to me and say, I'm</p>
<p t="80180" d="1780">majoring in computer science,
but I don't</p>
<p t="81960" d="1070">like to write programs.</p>
<p t="83030" d="3440">I've always been mystified
by that.</p>
<p t="86470" d="3430">I mean, if you want to show how
tough you are, you can go</p>
<p t="89900" d="2530">bungee jumping or drive a nail
through your hand or something</p>
<p t="92430" d="1250">like that instead.</p>
<p t="95850" d="2900">But I've written quite a few
programs for demonstrating</p>
<p t="98750" d="3900">stuff in this subject.</p>
<p t="102650" d="3870">They're all written in Java,
principally because I can</p>
<p t="106520" d="2140">therefore make them available to
you and to the rest of the</p>
<p t="108660" d="2125">world by way of Web Start.</p>
<p t="110785" d="4265">A few weeks ago, I was mucking
around with the system and</p>
<p t="115050" d="2440">broke the version on the server,
and within 15 minutes,</p>
<p t="117490" d="4000">I got an email from somebody
in the depths of Anatolia</p>
<p t="121490" d="2470">complaining about it and asking
me to bring it back up.</p>
<p t="127500" d="2199">This particular program
is patterned</p>
<p t="129699" d="5131">after an early AI classic.</p>
<p t="134830" d="4300">And it was the business end of
a program written by Terry</p>
<p t="139130" d="5160">Winograd, who became, and is,
a professor of computer</p>
<p t="144290" d="2930">science at Stanford
University--</p>
<p t="147220" d="1720">which is on the west coast
for those of you--</p>
<p t="151990" d="3520">on the strength of his work on
the natural language front end</p>
<p t="155510" d="1590">of this program.</p>
<p t="157100" d="3160">But the natural language part
is not what makes it of</p>
<p t="160260" d="3820">interest for us today.</p>
<p t="164080" d="4360">It's more the other
kinds of stuff.</p>
<p t="168440" d="3110">Let's pile these things up.</p>
<p t="171550" d="3770">Now, I'm going to ask to
do something, maybe put</p>
<p t="175320" d="3650">B2 on top of B7.</p>
<p t="187140" d="700">Not bad.</p>
<p t="187840" d="1480">How about B6 on B3?</p>
<p t="198500" d="2380">This program's kind of clever.</p>
<p t="205140" d="1440">Let me do one more.</p>
<p t="206580" d="1700">Let's put B7 on B2.</p>
<p t="219250" d="1260">OK, now let's see.</p>
<p t="220510" d="2020">Maybe B5 on B2?</p>
<p t="226170" d="3560">B4 on B3 first, maybe?</p>
<p t="232820" d="3065">Oh, I must have clicked
the wrong button.</p>
<p t="235885" d="790">Oh, there it goes.</p>
<p t="236675" d="2105">OK.</p>
<p t="238780" d="3936">Let's put B4 on B1.</p>
<p t="242716" d="5474">Agh, my mouse keeps getting
out of control.</p>
<p t="255660" d="1859">Now, let's put B1 on B2.</p>
<p t="257519" d="1260">This is an example I'm
actually going to</p>
<p t="258779" d="1250">work out on the board.</p>
<p t="263646" d="2094">Oh, I see.</p>
<p t="265740" d="2010">My touch pad accidentally
got activated.</p>
<p t="267750" d="2690">B1 on B2.</p>
<p t="284550" d="1250">Now, let's ask a question.</p>
<p t="298075" d="1485">OK.</p>
<p t="299560" d="630">Well.</p>
<p t="300190" d="1446">SPEAKER 2: [SINGING]</p>
<p t="301636" d="1928">PROFESSOR PATRICK
WINSTON: Stop.</p>
<p t="303564" d="3856">SPEAKER 3: [LAUGHTER]</p>
<p t="307420" d="1446">PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
Had enough of that.</p>
<p t="311760" d="790">Let's see.</p>
<p t="312550" d="2910">Why did you put--</p>
<p t="315460" d="7260">why did you want to
get rid of B4?</p>
<p t="322720" d="1940">OK, one--</p>
<p t="324660" d="3880">SPEAKER 2: [SINGING]</p>
<p t="328540" d="5470">PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: Maybe
they think, that's what</p>
<p t="334010" d="1565">happens when you use software
you write yourself.</p>
<p t="342010" d="9652">Why did you want to clear
the top of B2?</p>
<p t="351662" d="3388">Did I do that?</p>
<p t="355050" d="6000">Why did you clear
the top of B1?</p>
<p t="361050" d="470">OK.</p>
<p t="361520" d="1880">SPEAKER 2: [SINGING]</p>
<p t="363400" d="3300">SPEAKER 3: [LAUGHTER]</p>
<p t="366700" d="1760">PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
Oh, it's haunting me.</p>
<p t="368460" d="830">Yeah.</p>
<p t="369290" d="4060">So the drinking song is easily
offended, I guess.</p>
<p t="389160" d="2150">But I won't develop that
scenario again.</p>
<p t="391310" d="3950">What I want to show you is that
this program looks like</p>
<p t="395260" d="4170">it's kind of smart, and it
somehow can answer questions</p>
<p t="399430" d="800">about its own behavior.</p>
<p t="400230" d="1570">Have you ever written a program
that's answered</p>
<p t="401800" d="2220">questions about its
own behavior?</p>
<p t="404020" d="600">Probably not.</p>
<p t="404620" d="1702">Would you like to learn
how to do that?</p>
<p t="406322" d="1358">OK.</p>
<p t="407680" d="1790">So by the end of the hour,
you'll be able to write this</p>
<p t="409470" d="3930">program and many more like it
that know how to answer</p>
<p t="413400" d="1640">questions about their
own behavior.</p>
<p t="415040" d="1980">There have been tens of
thousands of such programs</p>
<p t="417020" d="3155">written, but only by people who
know the stuff I'm going</p>
<p t="420175" d="2905">to tell you about
right now, OK?</p>
<p t="423080" d="2160">So what I want to do is I want
to start by taking this</p>
<p t="425240" d="3260">program apart on the board and
talking to you about the</p>
<p t="428500" d="4170">modules, the subroutines
that it contains.</p>
<p t="432670" d="1400">So here it is.</p>
<p t="437440" d="2840">The first thing we need
to think about,</p>
<p t="440280" d="1250">here are some blocks.</p>
<p t="443600" d="3900">What has to happen if I'm going
to put the bottom block</p>
<p t="447500" d="2070">on the larger block?</p>
<p t="449570" d="3110">Well, first of all, I have
to find space for it.</p>
<p t="452680" d="2660">Then I have to grasp
the lower block.</p>
<p t="455340" d="3040">And I have to move it and
I have to ungrasp it.</p>
<p t="458380" d="4240">So those are four things I need
to do in order to achieve</p>
<p t="462620" d="1520">what I want to do.</p>
<p t="464140" d="8310">So therefore, I know that the
put-on method has four pieces.</p>
<p t="472450" d="5030">It has to find space on
the target block.</p>
<p t="477480" d="8020">It has to grasp the block that
it's been commanded to move.</p>
<p t="485500" d="5080">Then it has to move, and
then it has to ungrasp.</p>
<p t="495720" d="2960">But taking hints from some of
the questions that it did</p>
<p t="498680" d="4670">answer before I got haunted by
the music, taking our cue from</p>
<p t="503350" d="3500">that, we know that in order to
grasp something, in this</p>
<p t="506850" d="3300">particular world, you can't have
anything on top of it.</p>
<p t="510150" d="6779">So grasp, therefore, may call
clear top in order to get</p>
<p t="516929" d="4781">stuff off from the
target object.</p>
<p t="521710" d="3310">And that may happen in an
iterative loop because there</p>
<p t="525020" d="2430">may be several things on top.</p>
<p t="527450" d="1670">And how do you get
rid of stuff?</p>
<p t="529120" d="1250">Well, by calling get rid of.</p>
<p t="534810" d="2850">And that may go around
a loop several times.</p>
<p t="537660" d="6550">And then, the way you get rid of
stuff is by calling put-on.</p>
<p t="544210" d="2570">So that gives us recursion, and
it's from the recursion</p>
<p t="546780" d="2330">that we get a lot of the
apparent complexity of the</p>
<p t="549110" d="4810">program's behavior when
it solves a problem.</p>
<p t="553920" d="2910">Now, in order to find space,
you also have to</p>
<p t="556830" d="2240">call get rid of.</p>
<p t="559070" d="1750">So that's where I meant to
put this other iterative</p>
<p t="560820" d="1450">loop, not down here.</p>
<p t="562270" d="3130">Cleat top has got the iterative
loop inside of it.</p>
<p t="565400" d="1530">So that's the structure
of the program.</p>
<p t="566930" d="2680">It's extremely simple.</p>
<p t="569610" d="2200">And you might say to me, well,
how can you get such</p>
<p t="571810" d="2330">apparently complex-looking
behavior out of</p>
<p t="574140" d="925">such a simple program?</p>
<p t="575065" d="1600">A legitimate question.</p>
<p t="576665" d="4425">But before we tackle that one
head on, I'd like to do a</p>
<p t="581090" d="1780">simulation of this program
with a very</p>
<p t="582870" d="1250">simple blocks problem.</p>
<p t="588790" d="2590">And it's the one I almost
showed you, but</p>
<p t="591380" d="1800">it goes like this.</p>
<p t="593180" d="1606">Here's B1.</p>
<p t="594786" d="4134">We'll call this BX because
I forgot its name.</p>
<p t="598920" d="2330">Here's BY.</p>
<p t="601250" d="2130">And here's B2.</p>
<p t="603380" d="8700">And the task is to
put B1 on B2.</p>
<p t="612080" d="5010">And according to our system
diagram, that results in four</p>
<p t="617090" d="2320">calls to subroutines.</p>
<p t="619410" d="1250">We have to find space.</p>
<p t="625750" d="2245">We have to grasp B1.</p>
<p t="634270" d="4360">We have to move, and
then we ungrasp.</p>
<p t="644120" d="2140">Now, the way we grasp something
is the first thing</p>
<p t="646260" d="3640">we have to do is clear
off its top.</p>
<p t="663250" d="1390">So grasp calls clear top.</p>
<p t="668760" d="2140">And clear top in turn
calls get rid of.</p>
<p t="678080" d="540">And let me see.</p>
<p t="678620" d="1030">Let me keep track of these.</p>
<p t="679650" d="3980">This is clearing the top
of B1, and this is</p>
<p t="683630" d="2600">getting rid of BX.</p>
<p t="686230" d="8455">And the way we get rid of BX is
by putting BX on the table.</p>
<p t="698710" d="6090">And then that in turn causes
calls to another find space,</p>
<p t="704800" d="3514">another grasp, another move,
and another ungrasp.</p>
<p t="708314" d="3096">So that's a little trace of
the program as it works on</p>
<p t="711410" d="2550">this simple problem.</p>
<p t="713960" d="2480">So how does it go about
answering the questions that I</p>
<p t="716440" d="3220">demonstrated to you
a moment ago?</p>
<p t="719660" d="3680">Let's do that by using
this trace.</p>
<p t="723340" d="6470">So how, for example, does it
answer the question, why did</p>
<p t="729810" d="1250">you get rid of BX?</p>
<p t="737980" d="1540">[INAUDIBLE], what
do you think?</p>
<p t="739520" d="1823">How can it answer
that question?</p>
<p t="741343" d="1250">SPEAKER 4: [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p t="746280" d="3200">PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: So
it goes up one level and</p>
<p t="749480" d="2110">reports what it sees.</p>
<p t="751590" d="5210">So it says, and said in the
demonstration, I got rid of BX</p>
<p t="756800" d="3860">because I was trying to
clear the top of B1.</p>
<p t="760660" d="3665">So if I were to say why did you
clear the top of B1, it</p>
<p t="764325" d="2690">would say because I was
trying to grasp it.</p>
<p t="767015" d="2825">If I were to say, why did you
grasp B1, it would say because</p>
<p t="769840" d="2150">I was putting B1 on B2.</p>
<p t="771990" d="4130">If I say, why did you put
B1 on B2, it would say,</p>
<p t="776120" d="3790">slavishly, because
you told me to.</p>
<p t="779910" d="3860">OK, so that's how it deals
with why questions.</p>
<p t="783770" d="2850">How about how questions?</p>
<p t="789410" d="2270">Timothy, what do you think
about that one?</p>
<p t="791680" d="1720">How would it go about answering
a question about how</p>
<p t="793400" d="1250">you did something?</p>
<p t="797210" d="1190">Do you have a thought?</p>
<p t="798400" d="3028">TIMOTHY: Um, yeah, it would
think about what I was trying</p>
<p t="801428" d="322">to accomplish.</p>
<p t="801750" d="70">PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
Yeah, but</p>
<p t="801820" d="890">how would it do that?</p>
<p t="802710" d="1840">How would the program do that?</p>
<p t="804550" d="1600">We know that answering
a why question makes</p>
<p t="806150" d="2560">it go up one level.</p>
<p t="808710" d="1950">How does it answer
a how question?</p>
<p t="810660" d="1140">Sebastian?</p>
<p t="811800" d="760">SEBASTIAN: It goes
down one level.</p>
<p t="812560" d="1860">PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
You go down one level.</p>
<p t="814420" d="5790">So you start off all the way
up here with a put-on.</p>
<p t="820210" d="2150">You will say, oh, well I
did these four things.</p>
<p t="822360" d="1530">You say, why did you grasp B1?</p>
<p t="823890" d="2280">It will say because I was
trying to clear its top.</p>
<p t="826170" d="790">Why did you clear its top?</p>
<p t="826960" d="1970">Because I was trying
to get rid of it.</p>
<p t="828930" d="1150">Why were you trying
to get rid of it?</p>
<p t="830080" d="2810">Because I was trying to
put it on the table.</p>
<p t="832890" d="3680">So that's how it answers how
questions, by going down in</p>
<p t="836570" d="5710">this tree and this trace of the
program of action so as to</p>
<p t="842280" d="2820">see how things are
put together.</p>
<p t="845100" d="2840">What are these things that
are being put together?</p>
<p t="847940" d="2520">What's the word I've been
avoiding so as to bring this</p>
<p t="850460" d="2900">to a crescendo?</p>
<p t="853360" d="3950">What are these objectives, these
things it wants to do?</p>
<p t="857310" d="2220">They're goals.</p>
<p t="859530" d="6250">So this thing is leaving a
trace, which is a goal tree.</p>
<p t="865780" d="3480">Does that sound familiar?</p>
<p t="869260" d="2140">Three days ago, we talked about
goal trees in connection</p>
<p t="871400" d="2420">with integration.</p>
<p t="873820" d="2620">So this thing is building a goal
tree, also known as an</p>
<p t="876440" d="1880">and-or tree.</p>
<p t="878320" d="2620">So this must be an and tree.</p>
<p t="880940" d="3360">And if this is an and tree,
are there any and nodes?</p>
<p t="884300" d="1290">Sure, there's one right there.</p>
<p t="888860" d="4170">So do you think then that you
can answer questions about</p>
<p t="893030" d="3710">your own behavior as long as
you build an and-or tree?</p>
<p t="896740" d="1492">Sure.</p>
<p t="898232" d="2648">Does this mean that the
integration program could</p>
<p t="900880" d="3230">answer questions about
its own behavior?</p>
<p t="904110" d="1880">Sure.</p>
<p t="905990" d="2150">Because they both build goal
trees, and wherever you got a</p>
<p t="908140" d="2130">goal tree, you can answer
certain kinds of questions</p>
<p t="910270" d="1250">about your own behavior.</p>
<p t="915290" d="7620">So let me see if in fact it
really does build itself a</p>
<p t="922910" d="2750">goal tree as it solves
problems.</p>
<p t="925660" d="5900">So this time, we'll put
B6 on B3 this time.</p>
<p t="935400" d="1600">But watch it develop
its goal tree.</p>
<p t="942490" d="2460">So in contrast to the simple
example I was working on the</p>
<p t="944950" d="4776">board, this gets to be a pretty
complicated goal tree.</p>
<p t="949726" d="2824">But I could still answers
questions about behavior.</p>
<p t="952550" d="6880">For example, I could say, why
did you put B6 on B3?</p>
<p t="962440" d="2350">Because you told me to.</p>
<p t="964790" d="3300">All right, so the complexity of
the behavior is largely a</p>
<p t="968090" d="2690">consequence not of the
complexity of the program in</p>
<p t="970780" d="2450">this particular case, but the
building of this giant goal</p>
<p t="973230" d="4650">tree as a consequence of the
complexity of the problem.</p>
<p t="977880" d="2520">This brings us to one of
our previous matters--</p>
<p t="980400" d="3730">early on to one of the gold
star ideas of today.</p>
<p t="984130" d="4950">And this gold star idea goes
back to a lecture given in the</p>
<p t="989080" d="3390">late '60s by Herb Simon, who was
the first Nobel Laureate</p>
<p t="992470" d="3560">in the pseudo Nobel Prize
for economics.</p>
<p t="996030" d="660">Is that right, Bob?</p>
<p t="996690" d="700">Was he the first?</p>
<p t="997390" d="2420">All right, he was the first
winner of the Nobel Prize,</p>
<p t="999810" d="2990">pseudo Nobel Prize
in economics.</p>
<p t="1002800" d="2370">And in this lecture, which was
titled "The Sciences of the</p>
<p t="1005170" d="5330">Artificial," he said imagine
that you're looking on a beach</p>
<p t="1010500" d="3205">at the path of a ant.</p>
<p t="1013705" d="2875">And he said, well, you know,
the path of the ant looks</p>
<p t="1016580" d="1490">extremely complicated.</p>
<p t="1018070" d="4570">And you're tempted to think the
ant is some kind of genius</p>
<p t="1022640" d="3030">or monster brain ant.</p>
<p t="1025670" d="5110">But in fact, when you take a
closer look, what you discover</p>
<p t="1030780" d="3710">is that there are a bunch of
pebbles on the beach, and all</p>
<p t="1034490" d="5119">the ant is doing is avoiding
those pebbles on his way home.</p>
<p t="1039609" d="3841">So the complexity of the
behavior, said Simon, is a</p>
<p t="1043450" d="2450">consequence of the complexity
of the environment, not the</p>
<p t="1045900" d="2000">complexity of the program.</p>
<p t="1047900" d="2720">So that's the metaphoric
Simon's ant.</p>
<p t="1050620" d="9290">And what it says is that the
complexity of the behavior is</p>
<p t="1059910" d="10360">the max of the complexity of the
program and the complexity</p>
<p t="1070270" d="1250">of the environment.</p>
<p t="1078720" d="3240">So that's something we'll see
many times during the rest of</p>
<p t="1081960" d="870">the semester.</p>
<p t="1082830" d="2170">Complex behavior,
simple program.</p>
<p t="1085000" d="1105">You think it's going
to be complicated.</p>
<p t="1086105" d="3025">It turns out to be simple
because the problem has the</p>
<p t="1089130" d="2680">complexity, not the program.</p>
<p t="1094350" d="3000">So that brings us to check box
three in today's talk, and</p>
<p t="1097350" d="2170">there's a little bit of a scene
here because now I want</p>
<p t="1099520" d="4620">to stop talking about
goal-centered programming and</p>
<p t="1104140" d="4700">start talking about rule-based
expert systems.</p>
<p t="1108840" d="6350">The rule-based expert systems
were developed in a burst of</p>
<p t="1115190" d="3680">enthusiasm about the prospects
for commercial applications of</p>
<p t="1118870" d="6660">artificial intelligence
in the mid-1980s.</p>
<p t="1125530" d="4480">At that time, it was supposed
lengthy articles are written,</p>
<p t="1130010" d="2610">but you could account for
useful aspects of human</p>
<p t="1132620" d="3360">intelligence by writing all the
knowledge in the form of</p>
<p t="1135980" d="1890">simple rules.</p>
<p t="1137870" d="4830">So if this is true,
then that's true.</p>
<p t="1142700" d="4370">If you want to achieve
this, then do that.</p>
<p t="1147070" d="2620">But all the knowledge had to be
encapsulated in the form of</p>
<p t="1149690" d="2750">simple rules.</p>
<p t="1152440" d="1340">So what might you want
to do with this?</p>
<p t="1153780" d="1330">All sorts of things.</p>
<p t="1155110" d="1400">Thousands of these systems
were written,</p>
<p t="1156510" d="2250">as I indicated before.</p>
<p t="1158760" d="1130">But here's an example.</p>
<p t="1159890" d="1900">I'm going to work out an example
having to do with</p>
<p t="1161790" d="2080">identification.</p>
<p t="1163870" d="5110">And this example is patterned
off of a classic program,</p>
<p t="1168980" d="2905">strangely also written at
Stanford, called MYCIN.</p>
<p t="1171885" d="2325">It was developed to
diagnose bacterial</p>
<p t="1174210" d="2260">infections in the blood.</p>
<p t="1176470" d="670">So you come in.</p>
<p t="1177140" d="3660">You got some horrible disease,
and the doctor gets curious</p>
<p t="1180800" d="3080">about what antibiotic would be
perfect for your disease.</p>
<p t="1183880" d="1620">He starts asking a
lot of questions.</p>
<p t="1189380" d="5330">So I'm not going to deal with
that because that world has</p>
<p t="1194710" d="4540">all kinds of unpronounceable
terms like bacterioides and</p>
<p t="1199250" d="2060">anaerobic and stuff like that.</p>
<p t="1201310" d="3460">So it's completely analogous
to talk about identifying</p>
<p t="1204770" d="7440">animals in a little zoo, sort
of a small town type of zoo.</p>
<p t="1212210" d="3110">So I'm going to suggest that
we write down on a piece of</p>
<p t="1215320" d="3390">paper all the things we can
observe about an animal, and</p>
<p t="1218710" d="4500">then we'll try to figure
out what the animal is.</p>
<p t="1223210" d="3400">So I don't know, what
can we start with?</p>
<p t="1226610" d="1250">Has hair.</p>
<p t="1234440" d="3220">Then there are some
characteristics of the</p>
<p t="1237660" d="1420">following form.</p>
<p t="1239080" d="1250">Has claws.</p>
<p t="1245590" d="1250">Sharp teeth.</p>
<p t="1253580" d="1480">And forward-pointing eyes.</p>
<p t="1264390" d="3730">And these are all
characteristics of carnivores.</p>
<p t="1268120" d="2070">We happen to have
forward-pointing eyes too, but</p>
<p t="1270190" d="2370">that's more because we used to
swing around the trees a lot,</p>
<p t="1272560" d="1860">and we needed the
stereo vision.</p>
<p t="1274420" d="2110">And we don't have the claws
and the sharp teeth</p>
<p t="1276530" d="1870">that go with it.</p>
<p t="1278400" d="2630">But anyhow, those are typically
characteristics of</p>
<p t="1281030" d="2010">carnivores, as is eating meat.</p>
<p t="1288250" d="2840">And this particular little
animal we're looking at has</p>
<p t="1291090" d="4345">also got spots, and
it's very fast.</p>
<p t="1299770" d="2780">What is it?</p>
<p t="1302550" d="1930">Well, everybody says
it's a cheetah.</p>
<p t="1304480" d="2490">Let's see how our program
would figure that out.</p>
<p t="1306970" d="6240">Well, program might say, let's
see if it has hair, then rule</p>
<p t="1313210" d="4775">one says that that means
it must be a mammal.</p>
<p t="1323690" d="3760">We can imagine another rule that
says if you have sharp</p>
<p t="1327450" d="4960">claws, sharp teeth, and
forward-pointing eyes, then</p>
<p t="1332410" d="2340">you're a carnivore.</p>
<p t="1334750" d="2920">And I'm using sort of hardware
notation here.</p>
<p t="1337670" d="2270">That's an and gate, right?</p>
<p t="1339940" d="3100">So that means we have to have
all of these characteristics</p>
<p t="1343040" d="3130">before we will conclude that
the animal is a carnivore.</p>
<p t="1352490" d="4380">Now, this animal has been also
observed to eat meat.</p>
<p t="1356870" d="3880">So that means we've got extra
evidence that the animal is</p>
<p t="1360750" d="1950">carnivorous.</p>
<p t="1362700" d="9320">And now, because the animal is
a mammal and a carnivore and</p>
<p t="1372020" d="7680">has spots, and it's very fast,
then the animal is a cheetah.</p>
<p t="1385116" d="2734">And I hope all of our African
students agree that</p>
<p t="1387850" d="1150">it must be a cheetah.</p>
<p t="1389000" d="980">It's a small zoo--</p>
<p t="1389980" d="1440">I mean, a big zoo.</p>
<p t="1391420" d="410">Who knows what it is?</p>
<p t="1391830" d="1870">It's probably got some
unpronouncable name--</p>
<p t="1393700" d="1290">there's possibilities.</p>
<p t="1394990" d="2020">But for our small zoo,
that will do.</p>
<p t="1397010" d="3250">So we have group now written
down in the form</p>
<p t="1400260" d="2010">of these and gates.</p>
<p t="1402270" d="4760">Several rules, R1, R2--
and there needs to</p>
<p t="1407030" d="2010">be an and gate here--</p>
<p t="1409040" d="2625">that's R3 and an R4.</p>
<p t="1416950" d="3550">All of which indicate that
this animal is a cheetah.</p>
<p t="1420500" d="2655">So we built ourself a little
rule-based expert system that</p>
<p t="1423155" d="2245">can recognize exactly one
animal, but you could imagine</p>
<p t="1425400" d="3140">filling out this system with
other rules so that you could</p>
<p t="1428540" d="2210">recognize giraffes and penguins
and all the other</p>
<p t="1430750" d="1840">sorts of things you find
in a small zoo.</p>
<p t="1435890" d="2030">So when you have a system like
this that works as I've</p>
<p t="1437920" d="3316">indicated, then what we're
going to call that, we're</p>
<p t="1441236" d="3424">going to give that a special
name, and we're going to call</p>
<p t="1444660" d="11900">that a forward-chaining
rule-based--</p>
<p t="1456560" d="1250">because it uses rules--</p>
<p t="1466050" d="4353">expert system.</p>
<p t="1474320" d="3730">And we're going to put expert
in parentheses because when</p>
<p t="1478050" d="3230">these things were developed,
for marketing reasons, they</p>
<p t="1481280" d="4190">called them expert systems
instead of novice systems.</p>
<p t="1485470" d="2020">But are they really experts
in a human sense?</p>
<p t="1487490" d="4390">Not really, because they have
these knee-jerk rules.</p>
<p t="1491880" d="1620">They're not equipped with
anything you might want to</p>
<p t="1493500" d="2300">call common sense.</p>
<p t="1495800" d="3900">They don't have an ability to
deal with previous cases, like</p>
<p t="1499700" d="2240">we do when we go to
medical school.</p>
<p t="1501940" d="2230">So they really ought to be
called rule-based novice</p>
<p t="1504170" d="1950">systems because they reason
like novices on</p>
<p t="1506120" d="2050">the basis of rules.</p>
<p t="1508170" d="1415">But the tradition
is to call them</p>
<p t="1509585" d="2005">rule-based expert systems.</p>
<p t="1511590" d="6720">And this one works forward from
the facts we give it to</p>
<p t="1518310" d="1950">the conclusion off
on the right.</p>
<p t="1520260" d="2090">That's why it's a
forward-chaining system.</p>
<p t="1526850" d="1570">Can this system answer
questions</p>
<p t="1528420" d="1250">about its own behavior?</p>
<p t="1534715" d="1445">[INAUDIBLE], what
do you think?</p>
<p t="1536160" d="740">SPEAKER 5: [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p t="1536900" d="1110">PROFESSOR PATRICK
WINSTON: Why?</p>
<p t="1538010" d="2976">SPEAKER 5: [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p t="1540986" d="744">PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
Because it</p>
<p t="1541730" d="1736">looks like a goal tree.</p>
<p t="1543466" d="1494">Right.</p>
<p t="1544960" d="3170">This is, in fact, building a
goal tree because each of</p>
<p t="1548130" d="6870">these rules that require several
things to be true is</p>
<p t="1555000" d="1920">creating an and node.</p>
<p t="1556920" d="3260">And each of these situations
here where you have multiple</p>
<p t="1560180" d="2010">reasons for believing that the
thing is a carnivore, that's</p>
<p t="1562190" d="1770">creating an or node.</p>
<p t="1563960" d="1860">And we already know that you
can answer questions about</p>
<p t="1565820" d="4620">your own behavior if you leave
behind a trace of a goal tree.</p>
<p t="1570440" d="1180">So look at this.</p>
<p t="1571620" d="8640">If I say to it, why were
you interested in</p>
<p t="1580260" d="1260">the animal's claws?</p>
<p t="1581520" d="3500">Because I was trying to see
if it was a carnivore.</p>
<p t="1585020" d="3690">How did you know that the
animal is a mammal?</p>
<p t="1588710" d="2480">Because it has hair.</p>
<p t="1591190" d="2260">Why did you think it
was a cheetah?</p>
<p t="1593450" d="2740">Because it's a mammal,
a carnivore, has</p>
<p t="1596190" d="1820">spots, and very fast.</p>
<p t="1598010" d="3560">So by working forward and
backward in this goal tree,</p>
<p t="1601570" d="3420">this too can answer questions
about its own behavior.</p>
<p t="1604990" d="2030">So now you know how, going
forward, you can write</p>
<p t="1607020" d="3880">programs that answer questions
about their behavior.</p>
<p t="1610900" d="2050">Either you write the subroutines
so that each one</p>
<p t="1612950" d="2760">is wrapped around a goal, so
you've got goal-centered</p>
<p t="1615710" d="3710">programming, or you build a
so-called expert system using</p>
<p t="1619420" d="3590">rules, in which case it's easy
to make it leave behind a</p>
<p t="1623010" d="3170">trace of a goal tree, which
makes it possible to answer</p>
<p t="1626180" d="2490">questions about its own
behavior, just as this</p>
<p t="1628670" d="500">[INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p t="1629170" d="1250">program did.</p>
<p t="1632290" d="4040">But now, a little
more vocabulary.</p>
<p t="1636330" d="3930">I'm going to save time by
erasing all of these things</p>
<p t="1640260" d="1950">that I previously drew by
way of connections.</p>
<p t="1645818" d="7792">And I'm going to approach this
zoo in a little different way.</p>
<p t="1653610" d="5750">I'm going to not ask any
questions about the animal.</p>
<p t="1659360" d="4150">Instead, I'm going to say,
mommy, is this thing I'm</p>
<p t="1663510" d="2710">looking at a cheetah?</p>
<p t="1666220" d="4420">And how would mommy go about
figuring it out.</p>
<p t="1670640" d="3690">In her head, she would say,
well, I don't know.</p>
<p t="1674330" d="4095">If it's going to be a cheetah,
then it must be the case that</p>
<p t="1678425" d="6585">it's a carnivore, and it must be
the case that it has spots.</p>
<p t="1685010" d="4340">And it must be the case
that it's very fast.</p>
<p t="1689350" d="2860">So so far, what we've
established is that if it's</p>
<p t="1692210" d="2730">going to be a cheetah, it
has to have the four</p>
<p t="1694940" d="2940">characteristics that
mommy finds behind</p>
<p t="1697880" d="2560">this rule are four.</p>
<p t="1700440" d="4270">So instead of working forward
from facts, what I'm going to</p>
<p t="1704710" d="6750">do is work backward
from a hypothesis.</p>
<p t="1711460" d="4260">So here the hypothesis is
this thing is a cheetah.</p>
<p t="1715720" d="4390">How do I go about showing
whether that's true or not?</p>
<p t="1720110" d="4140">Well, I haven't done anything so
far because all I know is a</p>
<p t="1724250" d="2490">cheetah if all these things are
true, but are they true?</p>
<p t="1726740" d="4420">Well, to find out if it's a
mammal, I can use rule one.</p>
<p t="1731160" d="4110">And if I know or can determine
that the animal has hair, then</p>
<p t="1735270" d="2520">that part of it is
taken care of.</p>
<p t="1737790" d="4200">And I can similarly work my way
back through carnivore.</p>
<p t="1741990" d="4880">I say, well, it's a carnivore if
it has claws, sharp teeth,</p>
<p t="1746870" d="2810">and forward-pointing eyes.</p>
<p t="1749680" d="2180">And then as much as the
animal in question</p>
<p t="1751860" d="1860">does, then I'm through.</p>
<p t="1753720" d="835">I know it's a carnivore.</p>
<p t="1754555" d="2425">I don't have to go through and
show that it's a carnivore</p>
<p t="1756980" d="1250">another way.</p>
<p t="1758230" d="2170">So I never actually ask
questions about</p>
<p t="1760400" d="3200">whether it eats meat.</p>
<p t="1763600" d="4120">Finally, the final two
conditions are met by just an</p>
<p t="1767720" d="2300">inspection of the animal.</p>
<p t="1770020" d="1280">That's to say, it's
in the database.</p>
<p t="1771300" d="3100">I don't have to use any rules
to determine that the animal</p>
<p t="1774400" d="2890">has spots and is very fast.</p>
<p t="1777290" d="2320">So now, I've got everything in
place to say that it's a</p>
<p t="1779610" d="2880">cheetah, because it's a
carnivore, because it has</p>
<p t="1782490" d="2840">claws, sharp teeth, and
forward-pointing eyes, and all</p>
<p t="1785330" d="2650">the rest of this stuff is
similarly determined by going</p>
<p t="1787980" d="6190">backwards, backwards from the
hypothesis toward the facts,</p>
<p t="1794170" d="3560">instead of from the facts
forward to the conclusions.</p>
<p t="1797730" d="11450">So building a system that works
like that, I have a</p>
<p t="1809180" d="6800">backward-chaining rule-based
expert system.</p>
<p t="1815980" d="3060">But there's a very important
characteristic of this system</p>
<p t="1819040" d="3580">in both backward and forward
mode, and that is that this</p>
<p t="1822620" d="1780">thing is a deduction system.</p>
<p t="1829090" d="2670">That's because it's
working with facts</p>
<p t="1831760" d="1990">to produce new facts.</p>
<p t="1833750" d="1980">When you have a deduction
system, you can never take</p>
<p t="1835730" d="2190">anything away.</p>
<p t="1837920" d="2870">But these rule-based systems are
also used in another mode,</p>
<p t="1840790" d="1740">where it's possible to
take something away.</p>
<p t="1842530" d="2580">See, in fact world, in deduction
world, you're</p>
<p t="1845110" d="1810">talking about proving things.</p>
<p t="1846920" d="4400">And once you prove something
is true, it can't be false.</p>
<p t="1851320" d="2780">If it is, you've got a
contradiction in your system.</p>
<p t="1854100" d="2240">But if you think of this as a
programming language, if you</p>
<p t="1856340" d="3170">think of using rules as a
programming language, then you</p>
<p t="1859510" d="5260">can think of arranging it so
these rules add or subtract</p>
<p t="1864770" d="1610">from the database.</p>
<p t="1866380" d="5120">Let me show you an example
of a couple of systems.</p>
<p t="1871500" d="4150">First of all, since I've talked
about the MYCIN system,</p>
<p t="1875650" d="26260">let me show you an example
of a MYCIN dialogue.</p>
<p t="1901910" d="1840">That's a MYCIN dialogue.</p>
<p t="1903750" d="3570">And you can see the appearance
of words you have to go to</p>
<p t="1907320" d="1250">medical school to learn.</p>
<p t="1911000" d="2830">And here's a typical MYCIN rule,
just like the rules for</p>
<p t="1913830" d="4422">doing zoo analysis, only a
more complicated domain.</p>
<p t="1918252" d="2878">But here's another example of a
system that was written, not</p>
<p t="1921130" d="3170">in the '80s, but just a couple
of years ago by a student in</p>
<p t="1924300" d="5040">the architecture department,
Ph.D. thesis.</p>
<p t="1929340" d="3810">He was interested in the
architecture of a Portuguese</p>
<p t="1933150" d="2100">architect named Siza.</p>
<p t="1935250" d="2930">And Siza's done a lot of
mass housing stuff.</p>
<p t="1938180" d="2390">And Siza has the idea that you
ought to be able to design</p>
<p t="1940570" d="1930">your own house.</p>
<p t="1942500" d="4740">And so Jose Duarte, a Portuguese
student, a Ph.D.</p>
<p t="1947240" d="4020">student in architecture, wrote
a rule-based system that was</p>
<p t="1951260" d="4690">capable of designing Siza-like
houses in response to the</p>
<p t="1955950" d="3130">requirements and recommendations
and desires of</p>
<p t="1959080" d="3660">the people who are going
to occupy the houses.</p>
<p t="1962740" d="3410">So the most compelling part of
this thing, of this exercise,</p>
<p t="1966150" d="5630">was that Duarte took some of
the designs of the program,</p>
<p t="1971780" d="3550">mixed them up with some of the
designs of Siza, and put them</p>
<p t="1975330" d="3510">in front of Siza, and said,
which ones did you do?</p>
<p t="1978840" d="2710">And Siza couldn't tell.</p>
<p t="1981550" d="3050">So somehow, the rule-based
system that was built using</p>
<p t="1984600" d="3930">this kind of technology was
sufficient to confuse even the</p>
<p t="1988530" d="4510">expert that they were
patterned after.</p>
<p t="1993040" d="1515">But this program is a
little complicated.</p>
<p t="1994555" d="3155">It, too, has its own
specialized lingo.</p>
<p t="1997710" d="3750">So I'm not going to talk about
it in detail, but rather talk</p>
<p t="2001460" d="2860">instead about an analogous
problem.</p>
<p t="2004320" d="3590">And that is a problem that
everyone has faced at one</p>
<p t="2007910" d="3300">point or another, and that
is the problem of putting</p>
<p t="2011210" d="3742">groceries in a bag at
a grocery store.</p>
<p t="2014952" d="2158">It's the same thing, right?</p>
<p t="2017110" d="2660">Instead of putting rooms in
a house, you're putting</p>
<p t="2019770" d="1890">groceries in a bag.</p>
<p t="2021660" d="4980">And there must be some rules
about how to do that.</p>
<p t="2026640" d="3270">In fact, maybe some of you have
been professional grocery</p>
<p t="2029910" d="2510">store baggers?</p>
<p t="2032420" d="2450">[INAUDIBLE] a grocery store

<p t="2066889" d="3361">would tell me about how

<p t="2076154" d="1446">PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: Large

what she said</p>

<p t="2084090" d="2210">So if large, then bottom.</p>

Don't put too many heavy</p>

there's a very different</p>

about a red apple.</p>
<p t="2166250" d="4470">They'd sit back and say, oh,
I see you're contemplating</p>

<p t="2181460" d="1060">Amazing people.</p>
<p t="2182520" d="1640">Anyhow, where were we?</p>
<p t="2184160" d="3530">Oh, yes, bagging groceries.</p>
<p t="2187690" d="4000">So we're making some progress,
but not as</p>
<p t="2191690" d="1260">much as I would like.</p>
<p t="2192950" d="4850">And so in order to really make
progress on tasks like this,</p>
<p t="2197800" d="990">you have to exercise--</p>
<p t="2198790" d="4250">you know about some principles
of knowledge engineering.</p>
<p t="2203040" d="5270">So principle number one, which
I've listed over here as part</p>
<p t="2208310" d="4640">of a gold star idea, is deal
with specific cases.</p>
<p t="2212950" d="2920">So while you're at the site, if
all you do is talk to the</p>
<p t="2215870" d="3340">experts like Lisa and
[INAUDIBLE], all you're going</p>
<p t="2219210" d="2280">to get is vague generalities
because they won't think of</p>
<p t="2221490" d="1770">everything.</p>
<p t="2223260" d="2360">So what you do is you
say, well, let me</p>
<p t="2225620" d="2250">watch you on the line.</p>
<p t="2227870" d="1940">And then you'll see that they
have to have some way of</p>
<p t="2229810" d="2730">dealing with the milk.</p>
<p t="2232540" d="1680">And then you'll see that they
have to have some way of</p>
<p t="2234220" d="1380">dealing with the potato chips.</p>
<p t="2235600" d="3550">Nobody mentioned potato chips,
except insofar as they might</p>
<p t="2239150" d="1250">be squishy.</p>
<p t="2242650" d="1870">We don't have a definition
for squishy.</p>
<p t="2244520" d="3320">Nobody talked about
the macaroni.</p>
<p t="2247840" d="1950">And no one talked about
the motor oil.</p>
<p t="2249790" d="2260">This is a convenience store.</p>
<p t="2252050" d="3190">I don't want that in the
same bag with the meat.</p>
<p t="2255240" d="2650">And then no one talked
about canned stuff.</p>
<p t="2257890" d="2560">Here's a can of olives.</p>
<p t="2260450" d="5480">So by looking at specific cases,
you elicit from people</p>
<p t="2265930" d="2690">knowledge they otherwise would
not have thought to give you.</p>
<p t="2271210" d="4240">That's knowledge engineering
rule number one.</p>
<p t="2275450" d="1860">And within a very few minutes,
you'll have all three</p>
<p t="2277310" d="2170">knowledge engineering rules and
be prepared to be a highly</p>
<p t="2279480" d="1250">paid knowledge engineer.</p>
<p t="2283190" d="2160">Heuristic, let's call
these heuristics.</p>
<p t="2285350" d="1770">Heuristic number one,
specific cases.</p>
<p t="2287120" d="3980">Heuristic number two is ask
questions about things that</p>
<p t="2291100" d="3970">appear to be the same, but are
actually handled differently.</p>
<p t="2295070" d="5818">So there's some Birds Eye
frozen peas, and here--</p>
<p t="2300888" d="6272">ugh, some fresh cut
sweet peas.</p>
<p t="2307160" d="4380">And to me, the person who's
never touched a grocery bag in</p>
<p t="2311540" d="2360">my life-- maybe I'm
from Mars--</p>
<p t="2313900" d="1090">I can't tell the difference.</p>
<p t="2314990" d="1920">They're both peas.</p>
<p t="2316910" d="4070">But I observe that the experts
are handling these objects</p>
<p t="2320980" d="1670">differently.</p>
<p t="2322650" d="3290">So I say, why did you handle
those peas differently from</p>
<p t="2325940" d="2310">those peas, and what
do they say?</p>
<p t="2328250" d="3160">One's canned, and
one's frozen.</p>
<p t="2331410" d="1740">So what happens?</p>
<p t="2333150" d="4130">Bingo, I've got some new
words in my vocabulary.</p>
<p t="2337280" d="2380">And those new vocabulary words
are going to give me power</p>
<p t="2339660" d="1910">over the domain because
I can now use</p>
<p t="2341570" d="1810">those words in my rules.</p>
<p t="2343380" d="4160">And I can write rules like if
frozen, then put them all</p>
<p t="2347540" d="2370">together in a little
plastic bag.</p>
<p t="2349910" d="1750">Actually, that's too
complicated, but that's what</p>
<p t="2351660" d="1340">we end up doing, right?</p>
<p t="2353000" d="1720">Why do we put them
all together in a</p>
<p t="2354720" d="1421">little plastic bag?</p>
<p t="2356141" d="1964">SPEAKER 8: [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p t="2358105" d="982">PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
What's that?</p>
<p t="2359087" d="983">SPEAKER 8: [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p t="2360070" d="620">PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
Well, there are two</p>
<p t="2360690" d="1250">explanations.</p>
<p t="2364390" d="2360">There's the MIT explanation.</p>
<p t="2366750" d="4370">We know that temperature flow
is equal to the fourth power</p>
<p t="2371120" d="2280">of the temperature difference
and the surface area and all</p>
<p t="2373400" d="730">that kind of stuff.</p>
<p t="2374130" d="5370">We want to get them all together
in a ball, sphere.</p>
<p t="2379500" d="2160">The normal explanation is that
they're going to melt anyway,</p>
<p t="2381660" d="2148">so they might as well not
get everything else wet.</p>
<p t="2383808" d="976">All right.</p>
<p t="2384784" d="5856">SPEAKER 3: [LAUGHTER]</p>
<p t="2390640" d="2120">PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: So
that's heuristic number two.</p>
<p t="2392760" d="3380">And actually, there's heuristic
number three, that I</p>
<p t="2396140" d="3720">just want to relate to you for
the first time because I have</p>
<p t="2399860" d="1910">been dealing with it a lot
over this past summer.</p>
<p t="2401770" d="2390">Heuristic number three is you
build a system, and you see</p>
<p t="2404160" d="1660">when it cracks.</p>
<p t="2405820" d="1950">And when it cracks is when you
don't have one of the rules</p>
<p t="2407770" d="3360">you need in order to execute--</p>
<p t="2411130" d="2050">in order to get the program
to execute as</p>
<p t="2413180" d="1710">you want it to execute.</p>
<p t="2414890" d="2840">So if I were to write a grocery
store bagging program</p>
<p t="2417730" d="2560">and have it bag some groceries,
again, eventually</p>
<p t="2420290" d="2390">it would either make a mistake
or come to a grinding halt,</p>
<p t="2422680" d="1670">and bingo, I know that there's
a missing rule.</p>
<p t="2428150" d="3940">Isn't that what happens when you
do a problem set, and you</p>
<p t="2432090" d="2270">hit an impasse?</p>
<p t="2434360" d="2560">You're performing an experiment
on yourself, and</p>
<p t="2436920" d="3640">you're discovering that you
don't have the whole program.</p>
<p t="2440560" d="4580">In fact, I've listed this as a
gold star idea having to do</p>
<p t="2445140" d="2320">with engineering yourself
because all of these things</p>
<p t="2447460" d="2940">that you can do for knowledge
engineering are things you can</p>
<p t="2450400" d="1770">do when you learn a new
subject yourself.</p>
<p t="2452170" d="2560">Because essentially, you're
making yourself into an expert</p>
<p t="2454730" d="2210">system when you're learning
circuit theory or</p>
<p t="2456940" d="3290">electromagnetism or something
of that sort.</p>
<p t="2460230" d="2190">You're saying to yourself,
well, let's look at some</p>
<p t="2462420" d="1890">specific cases.</p>
<p t="2464310" d="2560">Well, what are the vocabulary
items here that tell me why</p>
<p t="2466870" d="1580">this problem is different
from that problem?</p>
<p t="2468450" d="2930">Oh, this is a cylinder
instead of a sphere.</p>
<p t="2471380" d="1820">Or you're working with a problem
set, and you discover</p>
<p t="2473200" d="2800">you can't work with the problem,
and you need to get</p>
<p t="2476000" d="1860">another chunk of knowledge
that makes it possible</p>
<p t="2477860" d="1740">for you to do it.</p>
<p t="2479600" d="3660">So this sort of thing, which
you think of primarily as a</p>
<p t="2483260" d="3140">mechanism, heuristics for doing
knowledge engineering,</p>
<p t="2486400" d="6115">are also mechanisms for making
yourself smarter.</p>
<p t="2496910" d="4080">So that concludes what I want to
talk with you about today.</p>
<p t="2500990" d="2330">But the bottom line is, that
if you build a rule-based</p>
<p t="2503320" d="1560">expert system, it can
answer questions</p>
<p t="2504880" d="1660">about its own behavior.</p>
<p t="2506540" d="3310">If you build a program that's
centered on goals, it can</p>
<p t="2509850" d="1965">answer questions about
its own behavior.</p>
<p t="2511815" d="2375">If you build an integration
program, it can answer</p>
<p t="2514190" d="1930">questions about its
own behavior.</p>
<p t="2516120" d="1830">And if you want to build one of
these systems, and you need</p>
<p t="2517950" d="2810">to extract knowledge from an
expert, you need to approach</p>
<p t="2520760" d="2850">it with these kinds of
heuristics because the expert</p>
<p t="2523610" d="2710">won't think what to tell you
unless you elicit that</p>
<p t="2526320" d="3360">information by specific cases,
by asking questions about</p>
<p t="2529680" d="3080">differences, and by ultimately
doing some experiments to see</p>
<p t="2532760" d="2090">where your program is correct.</p>
<p t="2534850" d="5110">So that really concludes what I
had to say, except I want to</p>
<p t="2539960" d="5120">ask the question, is this all
we need to know about human</p>
<p t="2545080" d="930">intelligence?</p>
<p t="2546010" d="1250">Can these things be--</p>
<p t="2547260" d="3240">are these things really smart?</p>
<p t="2550500" d="4390">And the traditional answer is
no, they're not really smart</p>
<p t="2554890" d="4720">because their intelligence is
this sort of thin veneer.</p>
<p t="2559610" d="4480">And when you try to get
underneath it, as written,</p>
<p t="2564090" d="2070">they tend to crack.</p>
<p t="2566160" d="3870">For example, we talk about a
rule, we could talk about a</p>
<p t="2570030" d="3260">rule that knows that you should
put the potato chips on</p>
<p t="2573290" d="1250">the top of the bag.</p>
<p t="2577080" d="3295">But a program that knows that
would have no idea why you</p>
<p t="2580375" d="3285">would want to put the potato
chips on top of the bag.</p>
<p t="2583660" d="1950">They wouldn't know that if you
put them on the bottom of the</p>
<p t="2585610" d="4260">bag, they'll get crushed.</p>
<p t="2589870" d="3440">And it wouldn't know that if
they get crushed, the customer</p>
<p t="2593310" d="4320">will get angry, because people
don't like to eat crushed</p>
<p t="2597630" d="1710">potato chips.</p>
<p t="2599340" d="1940">So that's what I mean when I
say the knowledge of these</p>
<p t="2601280" d="2510">things tends to be a veneer.</p>
<p t="2603790" d="4210">So the MYCIN program, during
debugging, once prescribed a</p>
<p t="2608000" d="3595">barrel of penicillin to be
administered to a patient for</p>
<p t="2611595" d="2745">its disease.</p>
<p t="2614340" d="4170">They don't know, they don't
have any common sense.</p>
<p t="2618510" d="5110">So the question then becomes,
well, I don't know.</p>
<p t="2623620" d="1840">Does rule-based--</p>
<p t="2625460" d="5090">do rules have anything to
do with common sense?</p>
<p t="2630550" d="2790">And I'm becoming a little bit
agnostic on that subject.</p>
<p t="2637840" d="2600">Because there are certain
indications, there are certain</p>
<p t="2640440" d="6160">situations, in which rules could
be said to play a role</p>
<p t="2646600" d="1895">in our ordinary understanding
of things.</p>
<p t="2651250" d="2310">Would you like to see
a demonstration?</p>
<p t="2653560" d="3500">What I'm going to show you,
when the clip speaks up--</p>
<p t="2657060" d="4580">well, before I make any
promises, let me see if I'm</p>
<p t="2661640" d="1270">actually connected to the web.</p>
<p t="2674260" d="2510">MIT, good.</p>
<p t="2676770" d="2050">MIT.</p>
<p t="2678820" d="880">Guest.</p>
<p t="2679700" d="1250">Yeah, that's me.</p>
<p t="2693820" d="1250">Sounds good.</p>
<p t="2723930" d="2720">OK, I just tested the system,
and I've seen it is actually</p>
<p t="2726650" d="1680">connected to the web.</p>
<p t="2728330" d="3900">And I'm going to adjust some
systems options here.</p>
<p t="2732230" d="2890">I'll get rid of the text box.</p>
<p t="2735120" d="3040">And we'll get rid of those
changes scale a little bit.</p>
<p t="2738160" d="2620">What I'm going to do is I'm
going to read a little</p>
<p t="2740780" d="3270">synopsis of the Macbeth plot.</p>
<p t="2744050" d="1140">You're MIT students.</p>
<p t="2745190" d="1730">I'm sure you're all classically
educated and very</p>
<p t="2746920" d="2910">familiar with Shakespearean
plots.</p>
<p t="2749830" d="3150">So I'm going to read one.</p>
<p t="2752980" d="3350">I'm going to read a version
of a Macbeth plot.</p>
<p t="2756330" d="2930">And it's going to go
along like this.</p>
<p t="2759260" d="3780">It's basically reading
a rule base so far.</p>
<p t="2763040" d="4870">And pretty soon, it's going to
get beyond the rule base and</p>
<p t="2767910" d="1525">start reading the
Macbeth story.</p>
<p t="2772320" d="1420">And there it is.</p>
<p t="2773740" d="980">It's read the Macbeth story.</p>
<p t="2774720" d="2140">Let me show you what the Macbeth
story looks like as</p>
<p t="2776860" d="1800">it's actually retained
by the system.</p>
<p t="2778660" d="660">That's it.</p>
<p t="2779320" d="1250">Read that.</p>
<p t="2785480" d="1830">OK, you ran out of
time because the</p>
<p t="2787310" d="1180">machine's already finished.</p>
<p t="2788490" d="2340">It takes about five seconds
to read this story.</p>
<p t="2790830" d="2090">Now, as you look at this little
synopsis of Macbeth,</p>
<p t="2792920" d="2590">there are a couple
things to note.</p>
<p t="2795510" d="3580">For one thing, it says that
Duncan is murdered.</p>
<p t="2799090" d="3560">Duncan, I hope this doesn't
bother you.</p>
<p t="2802650" d="1880">Duncan is murdered by Macbeth.</p>
<p t="2804530" d="3675">But at no time does it say
that Duncan is dead.</p>
<p t="2808205" d="2595">But you know Duncan's dead
because he was murdered.</p>
<p t="2810800" d="2368">If murdered, then dead.</p>
<p t="2813168" d="1832">SPEAKER 3: [LAUGHTER].</p>
<p t="2815000" d="1640">PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: So
if you look a little further</p>
<p t="2816640" d="5250">down, what you see is that
Macduff kills Macbeth.</p>
<p t="2821890" d="2370">Fourth line up from
the bottom.</p>
<p t="2824260" d="4150">Why did Macduff kill Macbeth?</p>
<p t="2828410" d="3220">Doesn't say why in this story,
but you have no trouble</p>
<p t="2831630" d="5320">figuring out that it's
because he got angry.</p>
<p t="2836950" d="3020">And when you get angry, you
don't necessarily kill</p>
<p t="2839970" d="1330">somebody, but it's possible.</p>
<p t="2841300" d="2890">SPEAKER 3: [LAUGHTER].</p>
<p t="2844190" d="1050">PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: So
now that you see what's in the</p>
<p t="2845240" d="3310">story, let me take you
back to this display.</p>
<p t="2848550" d="2660">It's what we call an
elaboration graph.</p>
<p t="2851210" d="2150">And when I blow it up, you can
see that there's some familiar</p>
<p t="2853360" d="1980">looking things in there.</p>
<p t="2855340" d="3290">For example, up here in the
left-hand corner, Macbeth</p>
<p t="2858630" d="3070">murders Duncan, right
over there.</p>
<p t="2861700" d="3810">And over here, Macduff
kills Macbeth.</p>
<p t="2865510" d="5200">And if you look at what is a
consequence of that, it looks</p>
<p t="2870710" d="2300">like there must be a rule that
says if you murder somebody,</p>
<p t="2873010" d="1660">you harm them.</p>
<p t="2874670" d="3870">And if you murder somebody,
then they're dead.</p>
<p t="2878540" d="2730">And one reason why you might
kill somebody is because they</p>
<p t="2881270" d="1230">angered you.</p>
<p t="2882500" d="3380">And if you go the other way,
one consequence of killing</p>
<p t="2885880" d="4280">somebody is that you harm them,
and that they die too.</p>
<p t="2890160" d="2960">And if you harm somebody, they
get angry, and their state</p>
<p t="2893120" d="1250">goes negative.</p>
<p t="2899050" d="3500">So that suggests that there are
some things that we have</p>
<p t="2902550" d="3595">on our hands that are very
compiled and very, strangely</p>
<p t="2906145" d="4825">enough, very rule-like
in their character.</p>
<p t="2910970" d="4760">Now, to close, I'm just
going to read Hamlet.</p>
<p t="2915730" d="3170">The Hamlet demonstration is
much like the Macbeth one.</p>
<p t="2918900" d="3370">In fact, Hamlet and Macbeth are
very alike in their plot.</p>
<p t="2922270" d="2260">But there's one thing that's
well-illustrated by our</p>
<p t="2924530" d="3410">particular capturing
of Hamlet here.</p>
<p t="2927940" d="2970">And that is that you'll note
that the ratio of gray stuff</p>
<p t="2930910" d="3150">to white stuff is
considerable.</p>
<p t="2934060" d="5750">The gray stuff is stuff that
has been deduced by rules.</p>
<p t="2939810" d="2330">And the reason there's so much
gray stuff in this Hamlet</p>
<p t="2942140" d="3240">story is because everybody's
related to everybody else.</p>
<p t="2945380" d="3540">So when you kill anybody, you
irritate everybody else.</p>
<p t="2952690" d="1060">So look at that.</p>
<p t="2953750" d="2560">A few white things, those are
the things that are explicit</p>
<p t="2956310" d="2320">in the story, and lots
of gray stuff.</p>
<p t="2958630" d="3640">So what this is suggesting is
that when we tell a story,</p>
<p t="2962270" d="3170">it's mostly a matter of
controlled hallucination.</p>
<p t="2965440" d="3120">I know what rules are in your
head, so I could take</p>
<p t="2968560" d="2470">advantage of that in telling the
story and not have to tell</p>
<p t="2971030" d="2460">you anything I'm sure you're
going to know.</p>
<p t="2973490" d="3150">And so that's why, we've
discovered, that storytelling</p>
<p t="2976640" d="2860">is largely a matter of just
controlling how you're going</p>
<p t="2979500" d="1510">along, a kind of controlled
hallucination.</p>
