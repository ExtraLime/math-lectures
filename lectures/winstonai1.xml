<p t="18200" d="7990">PATRICK WINSTON: Welcome
to 6034.</p>
<p t="26190" d="2040">I don't know if I can deal
with this microphone.</p>
<p t="28230" d="1175">We'll see what happens.</p>
<p t="29405" d="975">It's going to be a good year.</p>
<p t="30380" d="3150">We've got [INAUDIBLE] a bunch
of interesting people.</p>
<p t="33530" d="2260">It's always interesting to see
what people named their</p>
<p t="35790" d="4030">children two decades ago.</p>
<p t="39820" d="2690">And I find they were overwhelmed
with Emilys.</p>
<p t="42510" d="2910">And there are not too many
Peters, Pauls, and Marys, but</p>
<p t="45420" d="5120">enough to call forth a suitable
song at some point.</p>
<p t="50540" d="5090">We have lots of Jesses
of both genders.</p>
<p t="55630" d="1590">We have a [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p t="57220" d="2670">of both genders.</p>
<p t="59890" d="2920">And we have a Duncan,
where's Duncan?</p>
<p t="62810" d="1270">There you are, Duncan.</p>
<p t="64080" d="2820">You've changed your hairstyle.</p>
<p t="66900" d="3230">I want to assure use that the
Thane of Cawdor is not taking</p>
<p t="70130" d="2260">the course this semester.</p>
<p t="72390" d="2500">What I'm going to do is tell
you about artificial</p>
<p t="74890" d="3790">intelligence today, and what
this subject is about.</p>
<p t="78680" d="5420">There's been about a 10% percent
turnover in the roster</p>
<p t="84100" d="1220">in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p t="85320" d="4360">I expect another 10% turnover
in the next 24 hours, too.</p>
<p t="89680" d="2920">So I know many of you are
sightseers, wanting to know if</p>
<p t="92600" d="1120">this is something
you want to do.</p>
<p t="93720" d="2420">So I'm going to tell you about
what we're going to do this</p>
<p t="96140" d="4089">semester, and what you'll know
when you get out of here.</p>
<p t="100229" d="3391">I'm going to walk you through
this outline.</p>
<p t="103620" d="1919">I'm going to start by talking
about what artificial</p>
<p t="105539" d="3091">intelligence is, and
why we do it.</p>
<p t="108630" d="1530">And then I'll give you a little
bit of the history of</p>
<p t="110160" d="3840">artificial intelligence, and
conclude with some of the</p>
<p t="114000" d="2570">covenants by which we
run the course.</p>
<p t="116570" d="1570">One of which is no
laptops, please.</p>
<p t="120900" d="4720">I'll explain why we have these
covenants at the end.</p>
<p t="125620" d="1740">So what is it?</p>
<p t="127360" d="4860">Well, it must have something
to do with thinking.</p>
<p t="132220" d="3060">So let's start up here, a
definition of artificial</p>
<p t="135280" d="6540">intelligence, by saying that
it's about thinking,</p>
<p t="141820" d="2030">whatever that is.</p>
<p t="143850" d="2250">My definition of artificial
intelligence has</p>
<p t="146100" d="2460">to be rather broad.</p>
<p t="148560" d="3150">So we're going to say it's
not only about thinking.</p>
<p t="151710" d="7400">It's also about perception,
and it's about action.</p>
<p t="162610" d="3450">And if this were a philosophy
class, then I'd stop right</p>
<p t="166060" d="3060">there and just say, in this
subject we're going to talk</p>
<p t="169120" d="3250">about problems involving
thinking,</p>
<p t="172370" d="2490">perception, and action.</p>
<p t="174860" d="3030">But this is not a philosophy
class.</p>
<p t="177890" d="1160">This a Course six class.</p>
<p t="179050" d="1300">It's an engineering
school class.</p>
<p t="180350" d="1650">It's an MIT class.</p>
<p t="182000" d="1940">So we need more than that.</p>
<p t="183940" d="8440">And therefore we're going to
talk about models that are</p>
<p t="192380" d="7949">targeted at thinking,
perception, and action.</p>
<p t="200329" d="3471">And this should not be strange
to you, because model making</p>
<p t="203800" d="3100">is what MIT is about.</p>
<p t="206900" d="2640">You run into someone at a bar,
or relative asks you what you</p>
<p t="209540" d="3660">do at MIT, the right knee jerk
reaction is to say, we learned</p>
<p t="213200" d="1930">how to build models.</p>
<p t="215130" d="1860">That's what we do at MIT.</p>
<p t="216990" d="3580">We build the models using
differential equations.</p>
<p t="220570" d="2880">We build models using
probabilities.</p>
<p t="223450" d="4379">We build models using physical
and computational simulations.</p>
<p t="227829" d="2471">Whatever we do, we
build models.</p>
<p t="230300" d="5410">Even in humanities class, MIT
approach is to make models</p>
<p t="235710" d="4580">that we can use to explain the
past, predict the future,</p>
<p t="240290" d="2760">understand the subject,
and control the world.</p>
<p t="243050" d="1240">That's what MIT is about.</p>
<p t="244290" d="2110">And that's what this subject
is about, too.</p>
<p t="246400" d="4250">And now, our models are
models of thinking.</p>
<p t="250650" d="1410">So you might say,
if I take this</p>
<p t="252060" d="1780">classic will I get smarter?</p>
<p t="253840" d="920">And the answer is yes.</p>
<p t="254760" d="740">You will get smarter.</p>
<p t="255500" d="2480">Because you'll have better
models of your own thinking,</p>
<p t="257980" d="3140">not just the subject matter of
the subject, but better models</p>
<p t="261120" d="2720">of your own thinking.</p>
<p t="263840" d="1530">So models targeted at thinking,</p>
<p t="265370" d="2300">perception, and action.</p>
<p t="267670" d="1790">We know that's not quite enough,
because in order to</p>
<p t="269460" d="4330">have a model, you have to
have representation.</p>
<p t="273790" d="3250">So let's say that artificial
intelligence is about</p>
<p t="277040" d="15430">representations that support
the making of models to</p>
<p t="292470" d="2570">facilitate an understanding
of thinking,</p>
<p t="295040" d="2460">perception, and action.</p>
<p t="297500" d="1909">Now you might say to me, well
what's a representation?</p>
<p t="299409" d="761">And what good can it do?</p>
<p t="300170" d="2610">So I'd like to take a brief
moment to tell you about</p>
<p t="302780" d="760">gyroscopes.</p>
<p t="303540" d="2840">Many of you have friends in
mechanical engineering.</p>
<p t="306380" d="4600">One of the best ways embarrass
them is to say here's a</p>
<p t="310980" d="1230">bicycle wheel.</p>
<p t="312210" d="4510">And if I spin it, and blow hard
on it right here, on the</p>
<p t="316720" d="2390">edge of the wheel, is
going to turn over</p>
<p t="319110" d="4050">this way or this way?</p>
<p t="323160" d="3090">I guarantee that what they will
do is they'll put their</p>
<p t="326250" d="3150">hand in an arthritic posture
called the right hand screw</p>
<p t="329400" d="6470">rule, aptly named because people
who use it tend to get</p>
<p t="335870" d="5590">the right answer about
50% of the time.</p>
<p t="341460" d="3100">But we're never going to make
that mistake again.</p>
<p t="344560" d="1220">Because we're electrical
engineers,</p>
<p t="345780" d="1040">not mechanical engineers.</p>
<p t="346820" d="2480">And we know about
representation.</p>
<p t="349300" d="1990">What we're going to do is we're
going to think about it</p>
<p t="351290" d="1196">a little bit.</p>
<p t="352486" d="2294">And we're going to use some
duct tape to help us think</p>
<p t="354780" d="2950">about just one piece
of the wheel.</p>
<p t="357730" d="3540">So I want you to just think
about that piece of the wheel</p>
<p t="361270" d="1780">as the wheel comes flying
over the top, and I</p>
<p t="363050" d="1760">blow on it like that.</p>
<p t="364810" d="3280">What's going to happen
to that one piece?</p>
<p t="368090" d="2430">It's going to go off
that way, right?</p>
<p t="370520" d="2880">And the next piece is going
to go off that way too.</p>
<p t="373400" d="4210">So when it comes over, it
has to go that way.</p>
<p t="377610" d="1830">Let me do some ground f
here just to be sure.</p>
<p t="382200" d="1250">It's very powerful feeling.</p>
<p t="386760" d="1970">Try it.</p>
<p t="388730" d="810">We need a demonstration.</p>
<p t="389540" d="3470">I don't anybody think that
I'm cheating, here.</p>
<p t="393010" d="6830">So let's just twist it
one way or the other.</p>
<p t="399840" d="2260">So that's powerful
pull, isn't it.</p>
<p t="402100" d="4720">Alex is now never going to get
the gyroscope wrong, because</p>
<p t="406820" d="3050">he's got the right
representation.</p>
<p t="409870" d="2260">So much of what you're going to
accumulate in this subject</p>
<p t="412130" d="2430">is a suite of representations
that will help you to build</p>
<p t="414560" d="2430">programs that are intelligent.</p>
<p t="416990" d="3340">But I want to give you a second
example, one a little</p>
<p t="420330" d="970">bit more computational.</p>
<p t="421300" d="2690">But one of which was very
familiar to you by the time</p>
<p t="423990" d="2700">you went to first grade,
in most cases.</p>
<p t="426690" d="2920">It's the problem of the farmer,
the fox, the goose,</p>
<p t="429610" d="1410">and the grain.</p>
<p t="431020" d="3050">There's a river, a leaky rowboat
that can only carry</p>
<p t="434070" d="3270">the farmer, and one of
his four possessions.</p>
<p t="437340" d="740">So what's the right</p>
<p t="438080" d="3140">representation for this problem?</p>
<p t="441220" d="3150">It might be a picture
of the farmer.</p>
<p t="444370" d="5200">It might be a poem about the
situation, perhaps a haiku.</p>
<p t="449570" d="3670">We know that those are not
the right representation.</p>
<p t="453240" d="5100">Somehow, we get the sense that
the right representation most</p>
<p t="458340" d="4100">involve something about the
location of the participants</p>
<p t="462440" d="1830">in this scenario.</p>
<p t="464270" d="4210">So we might draw a picture
that looks like this.</p>
<p t="468480" d="5670">There's the scenario, and
here in glorious green,</p>
<p t="474150" d="4300">representing our algae infested
rivers is the river.</p>
<p t="478450" d="6856">And here's the farmer, the fox,
the goose, and the grain.</p>
<p t="485306" d="2594">An initial situation.</p>
<p t="487900" d="2843">Now there are other situations
like this one, for example.</p>
<p t="493360" d="5840">We have the river, and
the farmer, and the</p>
<p t="499200" d="2390">goose is on that side.</p>
<p t="501590" d="4570">And the fox and the grain
is on that side.</p>
<p t="506160" d="5360">And we know that the farmer can
execute a movement from</p>
<p t="511520" d="3409">one situation to another.</p>
<p t="514929" d="2051">So now we're getting somewhere
where with the problem.</p>
<p t="516980" d="2140">This is at MIT approach
to the farmer, fox,</p>
<p t="519120" d="890">goose, and grain problem.</p>
<p t="520010" d="1659">It might have stumped you when
you were a little kid.</p>
<p t="525370" d="1500">How many such situations
are there?</p>
<p t="530180" d="2452">What do you think, Tanya?</p>
<p t="532632" d="3648">It looks to me like all four of
individuals can be on one</p>
<p t="536280" d="2460">side or the other.</p>
<p t="538740" d="2740">So for every position the farmer
can be, each of the</p>
<p t="541480" d="2050">other things can be on either
side of the river.</p>
<p t="546060" d="3440">So it would be two to the fourth
she says aggressively</p>
<p t="549500" d="2560">and without hesitation.</p>
<p t="552060" d="1960">Yes, two to the fourth,
16 possibilities.</p>
<p t="554020" d="3570">So we could actually draw
out the entire graph.</p>
<p t="557590" d="2180">It's small enough.</p>
<p t="559770" d="4850">There's another position over
here with the farmer, fox,</p>
<p t="564620" d="1212">goose, and grain.</p>
<p t="565832" d="2728">And in fact that's
the one we want.</p>
<p t="568560" d="4100">And if we draw out the entire
graph, it looks like this.</p>
<p t="575910" d="4340">This is a graph of the
situations and the allowed</p>
<p t="580250" d="2710">connections between them.</p>
<p t="582960" d="4320">Why are there not 16?</p>
<p t="587280" d="1140">Because the other--</p>
<p t="588420" d="750">how many have I got?</p>
<p t="589170" d="455">Four?</p>
<p t="589625" d="2095">10?</p>
<p t="591720" d="3880">The others are situations in
which somebody gets eaten.</p>
<p t="595600" d="2890">So we don't want to go to
any of those places.</p>
<p t="598490" d="2360">So having got the
representation, something</p>
<p t="600850" d="1900">magical has happened.</p>
<p t="602750" d="1280">We've got our constraints
exposed.</p>
<p t="618420" d="1440">And that's why we build
representations.</p>
<p t="619860" d="3220">That's whey you algebra in high
school, because algebraic</p>
<p t="623080" d="2330">notation exposes the constraints
that make it</p>
<p t="625410" d="4220">possible to actually figure out
how many customers you get</p>
<p t="629630" d="1880">for the number of advertisements
you place in</p>
<p t="631510" d="1250">the newspaper.</p>
<p t="634420" d="2450">So artificial intelligence is
about constraints exposed by</p>
<p t="636870" d="2890">representations that support
models targeted to thinking--</p>
<p t="639760" d="1690">actually there's one
more thing, too.</p>
<p t="641450" d="1350">Not quite done.</p>
<p t="642800" d="5700">Because after all, in the end,
we have to build programs.</p>
<p t="648500" d="16320">So it's about algorithms enabled
by constraints exposed</p>
<p t="664820" d="4690">by representations that model
targeted thinking, perception,</p>
<p t="669510" d="1490">and action.</p>
<p t="671000" d="4520">So these algorithms, or we might
call them just as well</p>
<p t="675520" d="3100">procedures, or we might call
them just as well methods,</p>
<p t="678620" d="1410">whatever you like.</p>
<p t="680030" d="1950">These are the stuff of what
artificial intelligence is</p>
<p t="681980" d="2880">about-- methods, algorithms,
representations.</p>
<p t="684860" d="2610">I'd like to give you
one more example.</p>
<p t="687470" d="2100">It's something we call, in
artificial intelligence,</p>
<p t="689570" d="2200">generated test.</p>
<p t="691770" d="1870">And it's such a simple idea,
you'll never hear it again in</p>
<p t="693640" d="1200">this subject.</p>
<p t="694840" d="2290">But it's an idea you need to
add to your repertoire of</p>
<p t="697130" d="3650">problem solving methods,
techniques, procedures, and</p>
<p t="700780" d="2120">algorithms.</p>
<p t="702900" d="1250">So here's how it works.</p>
<p t="708380" d="3990">Maybe I can explain to best by
starting off with an example.</p>
<p t="712370" d="3220">Here's a tree leaf I picked
off a tree on</p>
<p t="715590" d="1170">the way over to class.</p>
<p t="716760" d="3190">I hope it's not the last
of the species.</p>
<p t="719950" d="1590">What is it, what kind of tree?</p>
<p t="725680" d="1040">I don't know.</p>
<p t="726720" d="3150">I never did learn my trees,
or my colors, or my</p>
<p t="729870" d="2040">multiplication tables.</p>
<p t="731910" d="5150">So I have to go back to this
book, the Audubon Society</p>
<p t="737060" d="1810">Field Guide to North
American Trees.</p>
<p t="738870" d="2290">And how would I solve
the problem?</p>
<p t="741160" d="630">It's pretty simple.</p>
<p t="741790" d="4700">I just turn the pages one at a
time, until I find something</p>
<p t="746490" d="2210">that looks like this leaf.</p>
<p t="748700" d="4490">And then I discover it's a
sycamore, or something.</p>
<p t="753190" d="2740">MIT's full of them.</p>
<p t="755930" d="3730">So when I do that, I do
something very intuitive, very</p>
<p t="759660" d="1410">natural, something you
do all the time.</p>
<p t="761070" d="1480">But we're going to
give it a name.</p>
<p t="762550" d="1300">We're going to call it
generate and test.</p>
<p t="775510" d="4280">And generate and test method
consists of generating some</p>
<p t="779790" d="4470">possible solutions, feeding
them into a box that tests</p>
<p t="784260" d="6500">them, and then out the other
side comes mostly failures.</p>
<p t="790760" d="4130">But every once in a while we
get something that succeeds</p>
<p t="794890" d="2350">and pleases us.</p>
<p t="797240" d="1720">That's what I did
with the leaf.</p>
<p t="798960" d="2380">But now you have
a name for it.</p>
<p t="801340" d="4150">Once you have a name
for something, you</p>
<p t="805490" d="1370">get power over it.</p>
<p t="806860" d="2110">You can start to
talk about it.</p>
<p t="808970" d="3210">So I can say, if you're doing
a generate and test approach</p>
<p t="812180" d="5100">to a problem, you better build
a generator with certain</p>
<p t="817280" d="2930">properties that make
generators good.</p>
<p t="820210" d="2730">For example, they should
not be redundant.</p>
<p t="822940" d="3270">They shouldn't give you the
same solution twice.</p>
<p t="826210" d="3470">They should be informable.</p>
<p t="829680" d="2940">They should be able to absorb
information such as, this is a</p>
<p t="832620" d="1030">deciduous tree.</p>
<p t="833650" d="2610">Don't bother looking
at the conifers.</p>
<p t="836260" d="1870">So once you have a name for
something, you can start</p>
<p t="838130" d="1240">talking about.</p>
<p t="839370" d="3210">And that vocabulary
gives you power.</p>
<p t="842580" d="4030">So we call this the
Rumpelstiltskin Principle</p>
<p t="846610" d="3920">perhaps The first of our
powerful ideas for the day.</p>
<p t="850530" d="1650">This subject is full
of powerful ideas.</p>
<p t="852180" d="2120">There will be some
in every class.</p>
<p t="854300" d="2180">Rumpelstiltskin Principle says
that once you can name</p>
<p t="856480" d="1770">something, you get
power over it.</p>
<p t="858250" d="970">You know what that little
thing is on</p>
<p t="859220" d="1250">the end of your shoelace?</p>
<p t="863650" d="630">It's interesting.</p>
<p t="864280" d="2200">She's gesturing like mad.</p>
<p t="866480" d="2440">That's something we'll talk
about later, too--</p>
<p t="868920" d="3150">motor stuff, and how
it helps us think.</p>
<p t="872070" d="1240">What is it?</p>
<p t="873310" d="2190">No one knows?</p>
<p t="875500" d="1280">It's an ag something, right?</p>
<p t="876780" d="2130">It's an aglet, very good.</p>
<p t="878910" d="2550">So once you have the name, you
can start to talk about.</p>
<p t="881460" d="2860">You can say the purpose of an
aglet is pretty much like the</p>
<p t="884320" d="1270">whipping on the end of a rope.</p>
<p t="885590" d="2550">It keeps the thing
from unwinding.</p>
<p t="888140" d="3000">Now you have a place to
hang that knowledge.</p>
<p t="891140" d="3590">So we're talking about this
frequently from now into the</p>
<p t="894730" d="1950">rest of the semester,
the power of being</p>
<p t="896680" d="1330">able to name things.</p>
<p t="898010" d="3840">Symbolic labels give us
power over concepts.</p>
<p t="901850" d="2440">While we're here I should also
say that this is a very simple</p>
<p t="904290" d="2280">idea, generate and test.</p>
<p t="906570" d="3200">And you might be tempted to
say to someone, we learned</p>
<p t="909770" d="1700">about generate and test today.</p>
<p t="911470" d="2820">But it's a trivial idea.</p>
<p t="914290" d="2740">The word trivial is a word I
would like you to purge from</p>
<p t="917030" d="5310">your vocabulary, because it's
a very dangerous label.</p>
<p t="922340" d="3630">The reason it's dangerous is
because there's a difference</p>
<p t="925970" d="1390">between trivial and simple.</p>
<p t="927360" d="2950">What is it?</p>
<p t="930310" d="3010">What's the difference between
labeling something as trivial</p>
<p t="933320" d="1250">and calling it simple?</p>
<p t="934570" d="1250">Yes?</p>
<p t="939440" d="1010">Exactly so.</p>
<p t="940450" d="4500">He says that simple can be
powerful, and trivial makes it</p>
<p t="944950" d="3880">sound like it's not only simple,
but of little worth.</p>
<p t="948830" d="4230">So many MIT people miss
opportunities, because they</p>
<p t="953060" d="2210">have a tendency to think that
ideas aren't important unless</p>
<p t="955270" d="2390">they're complicated.</p>
<p t="957660" d="2305">But the most simple ideas in
artificial intelligence are</p>
<p t="959965" d="2155">often the most powerful.</p>
<p t="962120" d="2010">We could teach an artificial
intelligence course to you</p>
<p t="964130" d="2050">that would be so full of
mathematics it would make a</p>
<p t="966180" d="2970">Course 18 professor gag.</p>
<p t="969150" d="2750">But those ideas would be
merely gratuitously</p>
<p t="971900" d="3690">complicated, and gratuitously
mathematical, and gratuitously</p>
<p t="975590" d="1350">not simple.</p>
<p t="976940" d="1850">Simple ideas are often
the most powerful.</p>
<p t="982460" d="2110">So where are we so far?</p>
<p t="984570" d="2595">We talked about the
definition.</p>
<p t="987165" d="2495">We talked about an example
of a method.</p>
<p t="989660" d="2900">Showed you a representation, and
perhaps also talked about</p>
<p t="992560" d="1660">the first idea, too.</p>
<p t="994220" d="2470">You've got the representation
right, you're</p>
<p t="996690" d="1750">often almost done.</p>
<p t="998440" d="2590">Because with this
representation, they can</p>
<p t="1001030" d="3550">immediately see that there are
just two solutions to this</p>
<p t="1004580" d="4350">problem, something that wouldn't
have occurred to us</p>
<p t="1008930" d="1700">when we were little kids, and
didn't think to draw the</p>
<p t="1010630" d="1250">[? state ?] diagram.</p>
<p t="1016640" d="1250">There's still one more thing.</p>
<p t="1021410" d="3330">In the past, and in other
places, artificial</p>
<p t="1024740" d="4368">intelligence is often taught
as purely about reasoning.</p>
<p t="1029108" d="3407">But we solve problems with
our eyes, as well as</p>
<p t="1032515" d="2905">our symbolic apparatus.</p>
<p t="1035420" d="3438">And you solved that problem
with your eyes.</p>
<p t="1038858" d="3981">So I like to reinforce that by
giving you a little puzzle.</p>
<p t="1042839" d="1791">Let's see, who's here?</p>
<p t="1050370" d="2050">I don't see [? Kambe, ?] but
I'll bet he's from Africa.</p>
<p t="1052420" d="2190">Is anyone from Africa?</p>
<p t="1054610" d="2570">No one's from Africa?</p>
<p t="1057180" d="1780">No?</p>
<p t="1058960" d="1250">Well so much the better--</p>
<p t="1066090" d="1670">because they would know the
answer to the puzzle.</p>
<p t="1067760" d="1470">Here's the puzzle.</p>
<p t="1069230" d="4040">How many countries in Africa
does the Equator cross?</p>
<p t="1076690" d="1600">Would anybody be willing
to stake their</p>
<p t="1078290" d="1460">life on their answer?</p>
<p t="1082520" d="1250">Probably not.</p>
<p t="1086910" d="9640">Well, now let me repeat
the question.</p>
<p t="1096550" d="2925">How many countries in Africa
does the Equator cross?</p>
<p t="1101995" d="1045">Yeah, six.</p>
<p t="1103040" d="2930">What happened is a miracle.</p>
<p t="1105970" d="3800">The miracle is that I have
communicated with you through</p>
<p t="1109770" d="4890">language, and your language
system commanded your visual</p>
<p t="1114660" d="3930">system to execute a program that
involves scanning across</p>
<p t="1118590" d="2800">that line, counting as you go.</p>
<p t="1121390" d="2380">And then your vision system
came back to your language</p>
<p t="1123770" d="2180">system and said, six.</p>
<p t="1125950" d="1625">And that is a miracle.</p>
<p t="1127575" d="3025">And without understanding that
miracle, we'll never have a</p>
<p t="1130600" d="2730">full understanding of the
nature of intelligence.</p>
<p t="1133330" d="2390">But that kind of problem solving
is the kind of problem</p>
<p t="1135720" d="2230">solving I wish we could teach
you a lot about it.</p>
<p t="1137950" d="2470">But we can't teach you about
stuff we don't understand.</p>
<p t="1140420" d="1080">We [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p t="1141500" d="1250">for that.</p>
<p t="1145540" d="3390">That's a little bit about the
definition and some examples.</p>
<p t="1148930" d="1530">What's it for?</p>
<p t="1150460" d="2070">We can deal with that
very quickly.</p>
<p t="1152530" d="3910">If we're engineers, it's for
building smarter programs.</p>
<p t="1156440" d="4250">It's about building a tool kit
of representations and methods</p>
<p t="1160690" d="1970">that make it possible to
build smarter programs.</p>
<p t="1162660" d="3000">And you will find, these days,
that you can't build a big</p>
<p t="1165660" d="2860">system without having embedded
in it somewhere the ideas that</p>
<p t="1168520" d="2710">we talk about in the subject.</p>
<p t="1171230" d="2190">If you're a scientist, there's
a somewhat different</p>
<p t="1173420" d="550">motivation.</p>
<p t="1173970" d="2450">But it amounts to studying
the same sorts of things.</p>
<p t="1176420" d="4380">If you're a scientist, you're
interested in what it is that</p>
<p t="1180800" d="3000">enables us to build a
computational account of</p>
<p t="1183800" d="1310">intelligence.</p>
<p t="1185110" d="1800">That's the part that I do.</p>
<p t="1186910" d="2710">But most this subject is going
to be about the other part,</p>
<p t="1189620" d="2820">the part that makes it possible
for you to build</p>
<p t="1192440" d="1070">smarter programs.</p>
<p t="1193510" d="3480">And some of it will be about
what it is that makes us</p>
<p t="1196990" d="5910">different from the chimpanzees
with whom we share an enormous</p>
<p t="1202900" d="2230">fraction of our DNA.</p>
<p t="1205130" d="2880">It used to be thought that we
share 95% of our DNA with</p>
<p t="1208010" d="1830">chimpanzees.</p>
<p t="1209840" d="3820">Then it went up to 98.</p>
<p t="1213660" d="1810">Thank God it stopped
about there.</p>
<p t="1215470" d="1300">Then it actually went
back a little bit.</p>
<p t="1216770" d="6580">I think we're back down to 94.</p>
<p t="1223350" d="1840">How about if we talk a little
bit now about the history of</p>
<p t="1225190" d="3750">AI, so we can see how we got
to where we are today?</p>
<p t="1228940" d="2100">This will also be a history of
AI that tells you a little bit</p>
<p t="1231040" d="1380">about what you'll learn
in this course.</p>
<p t="1236610" d="6120">It all started with Lady
Lovelace, the world's first</p>
<p t="1242730" d="5020">programmer, Who wrote programs
about 100 years before there</p>
<p t="1247750" d="2750">were computers to run them.</p>
<p t="1250500" d="3640">But it's interesting that even
in 1842, people were hassling</p>
<p t="1254140" d="3060">her about whether computers
could get really smart.</p>
<p t="1257200" d="6170">And she said, "The analytical
engine has no pretensions to</p>
<p t="1263370" d="2130">originate anything.</p>
<p t="1265500" d="4580">It can do whatever we know how
to order it to perform."</p>
<p t="1270080" d="3520">Screwball idea that persists
to this day.</p>
<p t="1273600" d="2130">Nevertheless, that was
the origin of it all.</p>
<p t="1275730" d="1600">That was the beginning
of the discussions.</p>
<p t="1277330" d="4720">And then nothing much happened
until about 1950, when Alan</p>
<p t="1282050" d="2060">Turing wrote his famous
paper, which</p>
<p t="1284110" d="2980">introduced the Turing test.</p>
<p t="1287090" d="2250">Of course, Alan Turing had
previously won the Second</p>
<p t="1289340" d="4750">World War by breaking the German
code, the Ultra Code,</p>
<p t="1294090" d="2150">for which the British government
rewarded him by</p>
<p t="1296240" d="1940">driving him to suicide, because
he happened to be</p>
<p t="1298180" d="2860">homosexual.</p>
<p t="1301040" d="3220">But Turing wrote his paper in
1950, and that was the first</p>
<p t="1304260" d="4460">milestone after Lady Lovelace's
comment in 1842.</p>
<p t="1308720" d="4420">And then the modern era really
began with a paper written by</p>
<p t="1313140" d="2980">Marvin Minsky in 1960, titled
"Steps Toward Artificial</p>
<p t="1316120" d="3410">Intelligence." And it wasn't
a long after that Jim</p>
<p t="1319530" d="1960">[? Slagle, ?]</p>
<p t="1321490" d="2340">a nearly blind graduate student,
wrote a program that</p>
<p t="1323830" d="3440">did symbolic integration.</p>
<p t="1327270" d="2580">Not adding up area under a
curve, but doing symbolic</p>
<p t="1329850" d="2020">integration just like you learn
to do in high school</p>
<p t="1331870" d="2600">when you're a freshman.</p>
<p t="1334470" d="2090">Now on Monday, we're going to
talk about this program.</p>
<p t="1336560" d="2170">And you're going to understand
exactly how it works.</p>
<p t="1338730" d="2840">And you can write
one yourself.</p>
<p t="1341570" d="2160">And we're going to reach way
back in time to look at that</p>
<p t="1343730" d="3670">program because, in one day
discussing it, talking about</p>
<p t="1347400" d="2100">it, will be in itself a
miniature artificial</p>
<p t="1349500" d="860">intelligence course.</p>
<p t="1350360" d="4890">Because it's so rich with
important ideas.</p>
<p t="1355250" d="4060">So that's the dawn age,
early dawn age.</p>
<p t="1359310" d="10500">This was the age of speculation,
and this was the</p>
<p t="1369810" d="1250">dawn age in here.</p>
<p t="1373820" d="3780">So in that early dawn age , the
integration program took</p>
<p t="1377600" d="790">the world by storm.</p>
<p t="1378390" d="1890">Because not everybody knows
how to do integration.</p>
<p t="1380280" d="3300">And someone, everyone, thought
that if we can do integration</p>
<p t="1383580" d="1840">today, the rest of intelligence
will be figured</p>
<p t="1385420" d="1462">out tomorrow.</p>
<p t="1386882" d="3698">Too bad for our side it didn't
work out that way.</p>
<p t="1390580" d="3620">Here's another dawn age
program, the Eliza</p>
<p t="1394200" d="1020">[? thing ?].</p>
<p t="1395220" d="2370">But I imagine you'd prefer
a demonstration to</p>
<p t="1397590" d="1865">just reading it, right?</p>
<p t="1399455" d="3415">Do you prefer a demonstration?</p>
<p t="1402870" d="1250">Let's see if we can
demonstrate it.</p>
<p t="1448250" d="3150">This is left over from a
hamentashen debate of a couple</p>
<p t="1451400" d="2011">of years ago.</p>
<p t="1453411" d="1639">How do you spell hamentashen,
anybody know?</p>
<p t="1459450" d="1150">I sure hope that's right.</p>
<p t="1460600" d="790">It doesn't matter.</p>
<p t="1461390" d="1250">Something interesting
will come.</p>
<p t="1465920" d="2660">OK, your choice.</p>

<p t="1475890" d="1250">Teal.</p>
<p t="1487810" d="1900">So that's dawn age AI.</p>
<p t="1489710" d="3990">And no one ever took that stuff
seriously, except that</p>
<p t="1493700" d="1200">it was a fun [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p t="1494900" d="3080">project level thing to work
out some matching</p>
<p t="1497980" d="1830">programs, and so on.</p>
<p t="1499810" d="1500">The integration program
was serious.</p>
<p t="1501310" d="1930">This one wasn't.</p>
<p t="1503240" d="3700">This was serious, programs that
do geometric analogy,</p>
<p t="1506940" d="2080">problems of the kind you find
on intelligence tests.</p>
<p t="1509020" d="970">Do you have the answer
to this?</p>
<p t="1509990" d="1350">A is to B as C is to what?</p>
<p t="1514260" d="1350">That would be 2, I guess.</p>
<p t="1518270" d="1250">What's the second best answer?</p>
<p t="1522070" d="2680">And the theories of the program
that solve these</p>
<p t="1524750" d="4240">problems are pretty much
identical to what you just</p>
<p t="1528990" d="1470">figured out.</p>
<p t="1530460" d="5510">In the first case you deleted
the inside figure.</p>
<p t="1535970" d="2310">And the second case is, the
reason you got four is because</p>
<p t="1538280" d="6060">you deleted the outside part
and grew the inside part.</p>
<p t="1544340" d="2330">There's another one.</p>
<p t="1546670" d="2840">I think this was the hardest one
it got, or the easiest one</p>
<p t="1549510" d="600">it didn't get.</p>
<p t="1550110" d="1190">I've forgotten.</p>
<p t="1551300" d="2870">A is to B as C is to 3.</p>
<p t="1557490" d="2690">In the late dawn age, we began
to turn our attention from</p>
<p t="1560180" d="2830">purely symbolic reasoning to
thinking a little bit about</p>
<p t="1563010" d="1590">perceptual apparatus.</p>
<p t="1564600" d="2810">And programs were written that
could figure out the nature of</p>
<p t="1567410" d="4390">shapes and forms,
such as that.</p>
<p t="1571800" d="2400">And it's interesting that those
programs had the same</p>
<p t="1574200" d="5720">kind of difficulty with
this that you do.</p>
<p t="1579920" d="2490">Because now, having deleted
all the edges, everything</p>
<p t="1582410" d="1430">becomes ambiguous.</p>
<p t="1583840" d="2950">And it may be a series of
platforms, or it may be a</p>
<p t="1586790" d="825">series of--</p>
<p t="1587615" d="2905">can you see the saw blade
sticking up if you go through</p>
<p t="1590520" d="1250">the reversal?</p>
<p t="1593790" d="1960">Programs were written that
could learn from a small</p>
<p t="1595750" d="1850">number of examples.</p>
<p t="1597600" d="3890">Many people think of computer
learning as involving leading</p>
<p t="1601490" d="4540">some neural net to submission
with thousands of trials.</p>
<p t="1606030" d="2250">Programs were written in the
early dawn age that learned</p>
<p t="1608280" d="3700">that an arch is something that
has to have the flat part on</p>
<p t="1611980" d="3200">top, and the two sides can't
touch, and the top may or may</p>
<p t="1615180" d="1250">not be a wedge.</p>
<p t="1619630" d="2250">In the late dawn age, though,
the most important thing,</p>
<p t="1621880" d="4422">perhaps, was what you look at
with me on Wednesday next.</p>
<p t="1626302" d="2818">It's a rule-based
expert systems.</p>
<p t="1629120" d="5620">And a program was written at
Stanford that did diagnosis of</p>
<p t="1634740" d="1780">bacterial infections
of the blood.</p>
<p t="1636520" d="4520">It turned out to do it better
than most doctors, most</p>
<p t="1641040" d="1820">general practitioners.</p>
<p t="1642860" d="4130">It was never used,
curiously enough.</p>
<p t="1646990" d="4370">Because nobody cares what your
problem actually is.</p>
<p t="1651360" d="2060">They just give you a broad
spectrum antibiotic that'll</p>
<p t="1653420" d="1250">kill everything.</p>
<p t="1656700" d="3000">But this late dawn age system,
the so-called [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p t="1659700" d="6740">system, was the system that
launched a thousand companies,</p>
<p t="1666440" d="2520">because people started building
expert systems built</p>
<p t="1668960" d="1080">on that technology.</p>
<p t="1670040" d="2090">Here's that you don't know
you used, or that was</p>
<p t="1672130" d="1300">used on your behalf.</p>
<p t="1673430" d="3140">If you go through, for example,
the Atlanta airport,</p>
<p t="1676570" d="2810">your airplane is parked by a
rule-based expert system that</p>
<p t="1679380" d="4050">knows how to park aircraft
effectively.</p>
<p t="1683430" d="6411">It saves Delta Airlines about
to $0.5 million a day of jet</p>
<p t="1689841" d="3939">fuel by being all smarter
about how to park them.</p>
<p t="1693780" d="1980">So that's an example of an
expert system that does a</p>
<p t="1695760" d="1400">little bit of good for
a lot of people.</p>
<p t="1699680" d="920">There's Deep Blue.</p>
<p t="1700600" d="7330">That takes us to the next stage
beyond the age of expert</p>
<p t="1707930" d="2480">systems, and the business age.</p>
<p t="1710410" d="2840">It takes us into this age
here, which I call the</p>
<p t="1713250" d="10010">bulldozer age, because this is
the time when people began to</p>
<p t="1723260" d="3130">see that we had at our disposal</p>
<p t="1726390" d="2310">unlimited amounts of computing.</p>
<p t="1728700" d="2180">And frequently you can
substitute computing for</p>
<p t="1730880" d="2050">intelligence.</p>
<p t="1732930" d="3490">So no one would say that Deep
Blue does anything like what a</p>
<p t="1736420" d="2810">human chess master does.</p>
<p t="1739230" d="4950">But nevertheless, Deep Blue,
by processing data like a</p>
<p t="1744180" d="2520">bulldozer processes gravel,
was able to</p>
<p t="1746700" d="1250">beat the world champion.</p>
<p t="1751910" d="1190">So what's the right way?</p>
<p t="1753100" d="2290">That's the age we're
in right now.</p>
<p t="1755390" d="3030">I will of course be inducing
programs for those ages as we</p>
<p t="1758420" d="1520">go through the subject.</p>
<p t="1759940" d="3010">There is a question of what
age we're in right now.</p>
<p t="1762950" d="1890">And it's always dangerous
to name an age when</p>
<p t="1764840" d="1800">you're in it, I guess.</p>
<p t="1766640" d="4020">I like to call at the age
of the right way.</p>
<p t="1770660" d="2610">And this is an age when we begin
to realize that that</p>
<p t="1773270" d="3480">definition up there is actually
a little incomplete,</p>
<p t="1776750" d="4880">because much of our intelligence
has to do not</p>
<p t="1781630" d="6290">with thinking, perception, and
action acting separately, but</p>
<p t="1787920" d="7590">with loops that tie all
those together.</p>
<p t="1795510" d="1980">We had one example
with Africa.</p>
<p t="1797490" d="4780">Here's another example drawn
from a program that has been</p>
<p t="1802270" d="2690">under development, and continues
to be, in my</p>
<p t="1804960" d="1250">laboratory.</p>
<p t="1811490" d="2010">We're going to ask the system
to imagine something.</p>
<p t="1818670" d="940">SYSTEM: OK.</p>
<p t="1819610" d="2796">I will imagine that a ball
falls into a bowl.</p>
<p t="1833098" d="486">OK.</p>
<p t="1833584" d="5346">I will imagine that a man
runs into a woman.</p>
<p t="1838930" d="1310">PATRICK WINSTON: You see, it
does the best that it can if</p>
<p t="1840240" d="3200">it doesn't have a good memory
of what these situations</p>
<p t="1843440" d="1565">actually involve.</p>
<p t="1845005" d="3125">But having imagined the
scene it can then--</p>
<p t="1848130" d="490">SYSTEM: Yes.</p>
<p t="1848620" d="3490">I have learned from experience
that contact between a man and</p>
<p t="1852110" d="4130">a woman appeared because a
man runs into a woman.</p>
<p t="1856240" d="1870">PATRICK WINSTON: Having imagined
the scene, it can</p>
<p t="1858110" d="3630">then read the answers using its
visual apparatus on the</p>
<p t="1861740" d="1840">scene that it imagined.</p>
<p t="1863580" d="2950">So just like what you did with
Africa, only now it's working</p>
<p t="1866530" d="2260">with its own visual memory,
using visual programs.</p>
<p t="1872026" d="481">SYSTEM: OK.</p>
<p t="1872507" d="4823">I will imagine that a man
gives a ball to a man.</p>
<p t="1877330" d="3720">PATRICK WINSTON: I know this
looks like slugs, but they're</p>
<p t="1881050" d="1250">actually distinguished
professors.</p>
<p t="1886500" d="1250">It always does the
best it can.</p>
<p t="1890465" d="986">SYSTEM: OK.</p>
<p t="1891451" d="2149">I will imagine that
a man flies.</p>
<p t="1899560" d="1920">PATRICK WINSTON: It's the
best that it can do.</p>
<p t="1907870" d="4050">So that concludes our discussion
of the history.</p>
<p t="1911920" d="2320">And I've provided you with a
little bit of a glimpse of</p>
<p t="1914240" d="3640">what we're going to look at
as the semester unfolds.</p>
<p t="1917880" d="2530">Yes, Chris?</p>
<p t="1920410" d="3470">CHRIS: Is it actually a
demonstration of something?</p>
<p t="1923880" d="2320">Does it have a large
database of videos?</p>
<p t="1926200" d="2476">PATRICK WINSTON: No, it has
a small database videos.</p>
<p t="1928676" d="4804">CHRIS: But it's intelligently
picking among them based on--</p>
<p t="1933480" d="2660">PATRICK WINSTON: Based
on their content.</p>
<p t="1936140" d="4430">So if you say imagine that a
student gave a ball to another</p>
<p t="1940570" d="2600">student, it imagines that.</p>
<p t="1943170" d="3260">You say, now does the other
student have the ball?</p>
<p t="1946430" d="1160">Does the other student
take the ball?</p>
<p t="1947590" d="2440">It can answer those questions
because it can review the same</p>
<p t="1950030" d="3220">video and see the take as well
as the give in the same video.</p>
<p t="1955760" d="7080">So now we have to think about
why we ought to be optimistic</p>
<p t="1962840" d="1620">about the future.</p>
<p t="1964460" d="2750">Because we've had a long history
here, and we haven't</p>
<p t="1967210" d="1620">solved the problem.</p>
<p t="1968830" d="2520">But one reason why we can feel
optimistic about future is</p>
<p t="1971350" d="3230">because all of our friends
have been on the march.</p>
<p t="1974580" d="3370">And our friends include the
cognitive psychologists, the</p>
<p t="1977950" d="980">[? developmental ?]</p>
<p t="1978930" d="3270">psychologists, the linguists,
sometimes the philosophers,</p>
<p t="1982200" d="1250">and especially the
paleoanthropologists.</p>
<p t="1986040" d="3390">Because it is becoming
increasingly clear why we're</p>
<p t="1989430" d="3350">actually different from the
chimpanzees, and how we got to</p>
<p t="1992780" d="1910">be that way.</p>
<p t="1994690" d="5220">The high school idea is that
we evolved through slow,</p>
<p t="1999910" d="3630">gradual, and continuous
improvement.</p>
<p t="2003540" d="2190">But that doesn't seem to
be the way it happened.</p>
<p t="2005730" d="4480">There are some characteristics
of our species that are</p>
<p t="2010210" d="3800">informative when it comes to
guiding the activities of</p>
<p t="2014010" d="2110">people like me.</p>
<p t="2016120" d="1830">And here's what the
story seems to be</p>
<p t="2017950" d="2650">from the fossil record.</p>
<p t="2020600" d="4730">First of all, we humans have
been around for maybe 200,000</p>
<p t="2025330" d="3880">years in our present
anatomical form.</p>
<p t="2029210" d="3930">If someone walked through the
door right now from 200,000</p>
<p t="2033140" d="7850">years ago, I imagine they
would be dirty,</p>
<p t="2040990" d="2760">but other than that--</p>
<p t="2043750" d="1350">probably naked, too--</p>
<p t="2045100" d="2970">other than that, you wouldn't
be able to tell the</p>
<p t="2048070" d="1250">difference, especially at MIT.</p>
<p t="2055840" d="6060">And so the ensuing 150,000 years
was a period in which we</p>
<p t="2061900" d="3259">humans didn't actually
amount to much.</p>
<p t="2065159" d="4911">But somehow, shortly before
50,000 years ago, some small</p>
<p t="2070070" d="4430">group of us developed a
capability that separated us</p>
<p t="2074500" d="3020">from all other species.</p>
<p t="2077520" d="2889">It was an accident
of evolution.</p>
<p t="2080409" d="2901">And these accidents may or may
not happen, but it happened to</p>
<p t="2083310" d="1889">produce us.</p>
<p t="2085199" d="2721">It's also the case that we
probably necked down as a</p>
<p t="2087920" d="2680">species to a few thousand, or
maybe even a few hundred</p>
<p t="2090600" d="4619">individuals, something which
made these accidental changes,</p>
<p t="2095219" d="1991">accidental evolutionary
products,</p>
<p t="2097210" d="3290">more capable of sticking.</p>
<p t="2100500" d="2320">This leads us to speculate on
what it was that happened</p>
<p t="2102820" d="1930">50,000 years ago.</p>
<p t="2104750" d="5770">And paleoanthropologists, Noam
Chomsky, a lot of people</p>
<p t="2110520" d="2060">reached similar conclusions.</p>
<p t="2112580" d="2470">And that conclusion is--</p>
<p t="2115050" d="1650">I'll quote Chomsky.</p>
<p t="2116700" d="2290">He's the voice of authority.</p>
<p t="2118990" d="3030">"It seems that shortly before
50,000 years ago, some small</p>
<p t="2122020" d="4020">group of us acquired the ability
to take two concepts,</p>
<p t="2126040" d="2980">and combine them to make a
third concept, without</p>
<p t="2129020" d="4520">disturbing the original two
concepts, without limit." And</p>
<p t="2133540" d="3570">from a perspective of an AI
person like me, what Chomsky</p>
<p t="2137110" d="2380">seems to be saying is, we
learned how to begin to</p>
<p t="2139490" d="2780">describe things, in a way
that was intimately</p>
<p t="2142270" d="1520">connected with language.</p>
<p t="2143790" d="2570">And that, in the end, is what
separates us from the</p>
<p t="2146360" d="2790">chimpanzees.</p>
<p t="2149150" d="1640">So you might say, well let's
just study language.</p>
<p t="2150790" d="2790">No, you can't do that, because
we think with our eyes.</p>
<p t="2153580" d="1930">So language does two things.</p>
<p t="2155510" d="2280">Number one, it enables us
to make descriptions.</p>
<p t="2157790" d="2250">Descriptions enable us
to tell stories.</p>
<p t="2160040" d="2360">And storytelling and story
understanding is what all of</p>
<p t="2162400" d="1330">education is about.</p>
<p t="2163730" d="1080">That's going up.</p>
<p t="2164810" d="4560">And going down enables us to
marshal the resources of our</p>
<p t="2169370" d="3580">perceptual systems, and even
command our perceptual systems</p>
<p t="2172950" d="4500">to imagine things we've
never seen.</p>
<p t="2177450" d="2670">So here's an example.</p>
<p t="2180120" d="2300">Imagine running down
the street with a</p>
<p t="2182420" d="2220">full bucket of water.</p>
<p t="2184640" d="1250">What happens?</p>
<p t="2187810" d="1290">Your leg gets wet.</p>
<p t="2189100" d="1680">The water sloshes out.</p>
<p t="2190780" d="3820">You'll never find that fact
anywhere on the web.</p>
<p t="2194600" d="2870">You've probably never been told
that that's what happens</p>
<p t="2197470" d="2440">when you run down the street
with a full bucket of water.</p>
<p t="2199910" d="3490">But you easily imagine this
scenario, and you know what's</p>
<p t="2203400" d="590">going to happen.</p>
<p t="2203990" d="3160">There was internal imagination
simulation.</p>
<p t="2207150" d="1880">We're never going to understand
human intelligence</p>
<p t="2209030" d="2640">until we can understand that.</p>
<p t="2211670" d="870">Here's another example.</p>
<p t="2212540" d="1130">Imagine running down
the street with a</p>
<p t="2213670" d="1950">full bucket of nickels?</p>
<p t="2215620" d="1250">What happens?</p>
<p t="2219460" d="955">Nickels weigh a lot.</p>
<p t="2220415" d="980">You're going to be bent over.</p>
<p t="2221395" d="2455">You're going to stagger.</p>
<p t="2223850" d="1840">But nobody ever told you that.</p>
<p t="2225690" d="2390">You won't find it anywhere
on the web.</p>
<p t="2228080" d="2640">So language is at the center of
things because it enables</p>
<p t="2230720" d="3660">storytelling going up, and
marshalling the resources of</p>
<p t="2234380" d="3860">the perceptual apparatus,
going down.</p>
<p t="2238240" d="2710">And that's where we're going
to finish the subject the</p>
<p t="2240950" d="2370">semester, by trying to
understand more about that</p>
<p t="2243320" d="2630">phenomenon.</p>
<p t="2245950" d="2200">So that concludes everything
I wanted to say about the</p>
<p t="2248150" d="2370">material and the subject.</p>
<p t="2250520" d="1770">Now I want to turn my attention
a little bit to how</p>
<p t="2252290" d="1800">we are going to operate
the subject.</p>
<p t="2254090" d="2825">Because there are many
characteristics of the subject</p>
<p t="2256915" d="1800">that are confusing.</p>
<p t="2263610" d="3230">First of all, we have
four kinds of</p>
<p t="2266840" d="1340">activities in the course.</p>
<p t="2297930" d="4940">And each of these has
a different purpose.</p>
<p t="2319580" d="1270">So I did the lectures.</p>
<p t="2320850" d="3060">And the lectures are supposed
to be an hour about</p>
<p t="2323910" d="2830">introducing the material
and the big picture.</p>
<p t="2326740" d="2140">They're about powerful ideas.</p>
<p t="2332138" d="3922">They're about the experience
side of the course.</p>
<p t="2336060" d="3070">Let me step aside and
make a remark.</p>
<p t="2339130" d="1260">MIT is about two things.</p>
<p t="2340390" d="5810">It's about skill building,
and it's about big ideas.</p>
<p t="2346200" d="3920">So you can build a skill at
home, or at Dartmouth, or at</p>
<p t="2350120" d="3710">Harvard, or Princeton, or all
those kinds of places.</p>
<p t="2353830" d="2450">But the experience you
can only get at MIT.</p>
<p t="2356280" d="1720">I know everybody there is
to know in artificial</p>
<p t="2358000" d="940">intelligence.</p>
<p t="2358940" d="1250">I can tell you about
how they think.</p>
<p t="2360190" d="1060">I can tell you about
how I think.</p>
<p t="2361250" d="1370">And that's something
you're not going to</p>
<p t="2362620" d="2500">get any other place.</p>
<p t="2365120" d="4520">So that's my role, as I see it,
in giving these lectures.</p>
<p t="2369640" d="4520">Recitations are four buttressing
and expanding on</p>
<p t="2374160" d="3270">the material, and providing a
venue that's small enough for</p>
<p t="2377430" d="1250">discussion.</p>
<p t="2380540" d="1660">Mega recitations are
[? a usual ?]</p>
<p t="2382200" d="1180">components of the course.</p>
<p t="2383380" d="2850">They're taught at the same
hour on Fridays.</p>
<p t="2386230" d="1870">Mark Seifter, my graduate
student,</p>
<p t="2388100" d="1410">will be teaching those.</p>
<p t="2389510" d="3630">And those are wrapped around
past quiz problems.</p>
<p t="2393140" d="2560">And Mark will show you
how to work them.</p>
<p t="2395700" d="4350">It's very important component
to the subject.</p>
<p t="2400050" d="2350">And finally the tutorials
are about helping</p>
<p t="2402400" d="2490">you with the homework.</p>
<p t="2404890" d="4270">So you might say to me,
well, do I really</p>
<p t="2409160" d="2430">need to go to class?</p>
<p t="2411590" d="3580">I like to say that the answer
is, only if you like to pass</p>
<p t="2415170" d="2700">the subject.</p>
<p t="2417870" d="2050">But you are MIT students.</p>
<p t="2419920" d="2270">And MIT people always like
to look at the data.</p>
<p t="2426150" d="3490">So this is a scattergram we
made after the subject was</p>
<p t="2429640" d="3370">taught last fall, which shows
the relationship between</p>
<p t="2433010" d="5670">attendance at lectures and the
grades awarded in the course.</p>
<p t="2438680" d="2140">And if you're not sure what
that all means, here's the</p>
<p t="2440820" d="1250">regression line.</p>
<p t="2446160" d="4240">So that information is a
little suspect for two</p>
<p t="2450400" d="5120">reasons, one of which is we
asked people to self report on</p>
<p t="2455520" d="2810">how many lectures they thought
they attended.</p>
<p t="2458330" d="4010">And our mechanism for assigning
these numerical</p>
<p t="2462340" d="1250">grades is a little weird.</p>
<p t="2466560" d="1910">And there's a third thing, too,
and that is, one must</p>
<p t="2468470" d="4390">never confuse correlation
with cause.</p>
<p t="2472860" d="2290">You can think of other
explanations for why that</p>
<p t="2475150" d="6080">trend line goes up, different
from whether it has something</p>
<p t="2481230" d="4610">to do with lectures producing
good grades.</p>
<p t="2485840" d="2230">You might ask how I feel about
the people up there on the</p>
<p t="2488070" d="2510">other upper left hand corner.</p>
<p t="2490580" d="2390">There are one or two people who
were near the top of the</p>
<p t="2492970" d="4220">subject who didn't go
to class at all.</p>
<p t="2497190" d="3700">And I have mixed feelings
about that.</p>
<p t="2500890" d="660">You're adults.</p>
<p t="2501550" d="1910">It's your call.</p>
<p t="2503460" d="3030">On the other hand, I wish that
if that's what you do</p>
<p t="2506490" d="3290">habitually in all the subjects
you take at MIT, that you</p>
<p t="2509780" d="2670">would resign and go somewhere
else, and let somebody else</p>
<p t="2512450" d="1330">take their slot.</p>
<p t="2513780" d="3270">Because you're not benefiting
from the powerful ideas, and</p>
<p t="2517050" d="1880">the other kinds of things
that involve</p>
<p t="2518930" d="2220">interaction with faculty.</p>
<p t="2521150" d="1200">So it can be done.</p>
<p t="2522350" d="960">But I don't recommend it.</p>
<p t="2523310" d="3660">By the way, all of the four
activities that we have here</p>
<p t="2526970" d="1470">show similar regression lines.</p>
<p t="2531280" d="1650">But what about that
five point scale?</p>
<p t="2532930" d="2010">Let me explain how that
works to you.</p>
<p t="2534940" d="3120">We love to have people
ask us what the class</p>
<p t="2538060" d="2370">average is on a quiz.</p>
<p t="2540430" d="3050">Because that's when we get
to use our blank stare.</p>
<p t="2543480" d="2700">Because we have no idea
what the class average</p>
<p t="2546180" d="2560">ever is on any quiz.</p>
<p t="2548740" d="1250">Here's what we do.</p>
<p t="2566110" d="2550">Like everybody else, we
start off with a score</p>
<p t="2568660" d="2020">from zero to 100.</p>
<p t="2570680" d="4070">But then we say to ourselves,
what score would you get if</p>
<p t="2574750" d="2510">you had a thorough understanding
of the material?</p>
<p t="2577260" d="3140">And we say, well, for this
particular exam, it's this</p>
<p t="2580400" d="2080">number right here.</p>
<p t="2582480" d="2150">And what score would you
get if you had a good</p>
<p t="2584630" d="870">understanding of the material?</p>
<p t="2585500" d="1840">That's that score.</p>
<p t="2587340" d="2700">And what happens if you're
down here is that you're</p>
<p t="2590040" d="2630">following off the edge of the
range in which we think you</p>
<p t="2592670" d="2270">need to do more work.</p>
<p t="2594940" d="3890">So what we do is, we say that if
you're in this range here--</p>
<p t="2598830" d="2690">following MIT convention
with GPAs and stuff,</p>
<p t="2601520" d="1920">that gets you a five.</p>
<p t="2603440" d="1860">If you're in this range
down here, there's a</p>
<p t="2605300" d="2870">sharp drop off to four.</p>
<p t="2608170" d="1540">If you're in this range
down here, there's a</p>
<p t="2609710" d="3360">sharp fall off to three.</p>
<p t="2613070" d="1880">So that means if you're in the
middle of one of those</p>
<p t="2614950" d="2840">plateaus there's no point
in arguing with this.</p>
<p t="2617790" d="2760">Because it's not going
to do you any good.</p>
<p t="2620550" d="2470">We have these boundaries where
we think performance break</p>
<p t="2623020" d="2410">points are.</p>
<p t="2625430" d="2440">So you say, well that seems
a little harsh.</p>
<p t="2627870" d="1980">Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
and start arguing.</p>
<p t="2629850" d="3710">But then we will come back with
a second major innovation</p>
<p t="2633560" d="1300">we have in the course.</p>
<p t="2634860" d="5440">That is that your grade is
calculated in several parts.</p>
<p t="2640300" d="6670">Part one is the max of
your grade on Q1, and</p>
<p t="2646970" d="2860">part one of the final.</p>
<p t="2649830" d="2950">So in other words, you get
two shots at everything.</p>
<p t="2652780" d="5300">So if you have complete glorious
undeniable horrible F</p>
<p t="2658080" d="3460">on the first quiz, it gets
erased on the final if you do</p>
<p t="2661540" d="2370">well on that part
of the final.</p>
<p t="2663910" d="1680">So each quiz has
a corresponding</p>
<p t="2665590" d="1490">mirror on the final.</p>
<p t="2667080" d="5600">You get the max of the score you
got on those two pieces.</p>
<p t="2672680" d="3860">And now you say to me,
I'm an MIT student.</p>
<p t="2676540" d="1526">I have a lot of guts.</p>
<p t="2678066" d="1674">I'm only going to
take the final.</p>
<p t="2684020" d="2040">It has been done.</p>
<p t="2686060" d="3340">We don't recommend it.</p>
<p t="2689400" d="2570">And the reason we don't
recommend it is that we don't</p>
<p t="2691970" d="1760">expect everybody to do
all of the final.</p>
<p t="2693730" d="2010">So there would be a lot of time
pressure if you had to do</p>
<p t="2695740" d="4460">all of the final, all five
parts of the final.</p>
<p t="2700200" d="2690">So we have four quizzes.</p>
<p t="2702890" d="2700">And the final has a fifth part
because there's some material</p>
<p t="2705590" d="3120">that we teach you after the last
date on which we can give</p>
<p t="2708710" d="2300">you a final by institute
rules.</p>
<p t="2711010" d="1040">But that's roughly
how it works.</p>
<p t="2712050" d="4640">And you can read about more of
the details in the FAQ on the</p>
<p t="2716690" d="1250">subject homepage.</p>
<p t="2719910" d="1140">So now we're almost done.</p>
<p t="2721050" d="3140">I just want to talk a little bit
about how we're going to</p>
<p t="2724190" d="3650">communicate with you in the
next few days, while we're</p>
<p t="2727840" d="1870">getting ourselves organized.</p>
<p t="2729710" d="2850">So, number one-- if I could ask
the TAs to help me pass</p>
<p t="2732560" d="2010">these out--</p>
<p t="2734570" d="3320">we need to schedule you
into tutorials.</p>
<p t="2737890" d="2080">So we're going to ask you to
fill out this form, and give</p>
<p t="2739970" d="1250">it to us before you leave.</p>
<p t="2744250" d="4660">So you'll be hearing from
us once we do the sort.</p>
<p t="2748910" d="9190">There's the issue of whether
we're going to have ordinary</p>
<p t="2758100" d="2400">recitation and a mega recitation
this week.</p>
<p t="2760500" d="960">So pay attention.</p>
<p t="2761460" d="2170">Otherwise, you're going to be
stranded in a classroom with</p>
<p t="2763630" d="1360">nothing to do.</p>
<p t="2764990" d="2460">We're not going to have any
regular recitations this week.</p>
<p t="2770010" d="1400">Are we having regular recitation
this week,</p>
<p t="2771410" d="310">[INAUDIBLE]?</p>
<p t="2771720" d="2550">No.</p>
<p t="2774270" d="5620">We may, and probably will, have
a mega recitation this</p>
<p t="2779890" d="4590">week that's devoted to
a Python review.</p>
<p t="2784480" d="3330">Now we know that there are
many of you who are</p>
<p t="2787810" d="3440">celebrating a religious holiday
on Friday, and so we</p>
<p t="2791250" d="3430">will be putting a lot of
resources online so you can</p>
<p t="2794680" d="3380">get that review in
another way.</p>
<p t="2798060" d="4680">We probably will have a Python
review on Friday.</p>
<p t="2802740" d="2900">And we ask that you look at
our home page for further</p>
<p t="2805640" d="3880">information about that as
the week progresses.</p>
<p t="2809520" d="1120">So that's all folks.</p>
<p t="2810640" d="1830">That concludes what we're
going to do today.</p>
<p t="2812470" d="4280">And as soon as you give us
your form, we're through.</p>
