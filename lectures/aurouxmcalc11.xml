<p t="23000" d="4000">So far we have learned about
partial derivatives and how to</p>
<p t="27000" d="4000">use them to find minima and
maxima of functions of two</p>
<p t="31000" d="4000">variables or several variables.
And now we are going to try to</p>
<p t="35000" d="3000">study, in more detail,
how functions of several</p>
<p t="38000" d="3000">variables behave,
how to compete their</p>
<p t="41000" d="3000">variations.
How to estimate the variation</p>
<p t="44000" d="6000">in arbitrary directions.
And so for that we are going to</p>
<p t="50000" d="6000">need some more tools actually to
study this things.</p>
<p t="56000" d="4000">More tools to study functions.</p>
<p t="75000" d="11000">Today's topic is going to be
differentials.</p>
<p t="86000" d="8000">And, just to motivate that,
let me remind you about one</p>
<p t="94000" d="9000">trick that you probably know
from single variable calculus,</p>
<p t="103000" d="5000">namely implicit
differentiation.</p>
<p t="108000" d="8000">Let's say that you have a
function y equals f of x then</p>
<p t="116000" d="9000">you would sometimes write dy
equals f prime of x times dx.</p>
<p t="125000" d="12000">And then maybe you would -- We
use implicit differentiation to</p>
<p t="137000" d="12000">actually relate infinitesimal
changes in y with infinitesimal</p>
<p t="149000" d="6000">changes in x.
And one thing we can do with</p>
<p t="155000" d="4000">that, for example,
is actually figure out the rate</p>
<p t="159000" d="4000">of change dy by dx,
but also the reciprocal dx by</p>
<p t="163000" d="5000">dy.
And so, for example,</p>
<p t="168000" d="10000">let's say that we have y equals
inverse sin(x).</p>
<p t="178000" d="5000">Then we can write x equals
sin(y).</p>
<p t="183000" d="5000">And, from there,
we can actually find out what</p>
<p t="188000" d="5000">is the derivative of this
function if we didn't know the</p>
<p t="193000" d="5000">answer already by writing dx
equals cosine y dy.</p>
<p t="198000" d="10000">That tells us that dy over dx
is going to be one over cosine</p>
<p t="208000" d="4000">y.
And now cosine for relation to</p>
<p t="212000" d="8000">sine is basically one over
square root of one minus x^2.</p>
<p t="220000" d="4000">And that is how you find the
formula for the derivative of</p>
<p t="224000" d="6000">the inverse sine function.
A formula that you probably</p>
<p t="230000" d="4000">already knew,
but that is one way to derive</p>
<p t="234000" d="3000">it.
Now we are going to use also</p>
<p t="237000" d="2000">these kinds of notations,
dx, dy and so on,</p>
<p t="239000" d="4000">but use them for functions of
several variables.</p>
<p t="243000" d="2000">And, of course,
we will have to learn what the</p>
<p t="245000" d="3000">rules of manipulation are and
what we can do with them.</p>
<p t="257000" d="3000">The actual name of that is the
total differential,</p>
<p t="260000" d="3000">as opposed to the partial
derivatives.</p>
<p t="263000" d="5000">The total differential includes
all of the various causes that</p>
<p t="268000" d="5000">can change -- Sorry.
All the contributions that can</p>
<p t="273000" d="5000">cause the value of your function
f to change.</p>
<p t="278000" d="5000">Namely, let's say that you have
a function maybe of three</p>
<p t="283000" d="1000">variables, x,
y, z,</p>
<p t="284000" d="12000">then you would write df equals
f sub x dx plus f sub y dy plus</p>
<p t="296000" d="6000">f sub z dz.
Maybe, just to remind you of</p>
<p t="302000" d="5000">the other notation,
partial f over partial x dx</p>
<p t="307000" d="7000">plus partial f over partial y dy
plus partial f over partial z</p>
<p t="314000" d="4000">dz.
Now, what is this object?</p>
<p t="318000" d="4000">What are the things on either
side of this equality?</p>
<p t="322000" d="2000">Well, they are called
differentials.</p>
<p t="324000" d="2000">And they are not numbers,
they are not vectors,</p>
<p t="326000" d="3000">they are not matrices,
they are a different kind of</p>
<p t="329000" d="3000">object.
These things have their own</p>
<p t="332000" d="4000">rules of manipulations,
and we have to learn what we</p>
<p t="336000" d="4000">can do with them.
So how do we think about them?</p>
<p t="340000" d="11000">First of all,
how do we not think about them?</p>
<p t="351000" d="4000">Here is an important thing to
know.</p>
<p t="355000" d="12000">Important.
df is not the same thing as</p>
<p t="367000" d="5000">delta f.
That is meant to be a number.</p>
<p t="372000" d="4000">It is going to be a number once
you have a small variation of x,</p>
<p t="376000" d="3000">a small variation of y,
a small variation of z.</p>
<p t="379000" d="2000">These are numbers.
Delta x, delta y and delta z</p>
<p t="381000" d="3000">are actual numbers,
and this becomes a number.</p>
<p t="384000" d="2000">This guy actually is not a
number.</p>
<p t="386000" d="4000">You cannot give it a particular
value.</p>
<p t="390000" d="3000">All you can do with a
differential is express it in</p>
<p t="393000" d="3000">terms of other differentials.
In fact, this dx,</p>
<p t="396000" d="2000">dy and dz, well,
they are mostly symbols out</p>
<p t="398000" d="4000">there.
But if you want to think about</p>
<p t="402000" d="4000">them, they are the differentials
of x, y and z.</p>
<p t="406000" d="6000">In fact, you can think of these
differentials as placeholders</p>
<p t="412000" d="5000">where you will put other things.
Of course, they represent,</p>
<p t="417000" d="5000">you know, there is this idea of
changes in x,</p>
<p t="422000" d="3000">y, z and f.
One way that one could explain</p>
<p t="425000" d="4000">it, and I don't really like it,
is to say they represent</p>
<p t="429000" d="3000">infinitesimal changes.
Another way to say it,</p>
<p t="432000" d="2000">and I think that is probably
closer to the truth,</p>
<p t="434000" d="5000">is that these things are
somehow placeholders to put</p>
<p t="439000" d="3000">values and get a tangent
approximation.</p>
<p t="442000" d="3000">For example,
if I do replace these symbols</p>
<p t="445000" d="5000">by delta x, delta y and delta z
numbers then I will actually get</p>
<p t="450000" d="3000">a numerical quantity.
And that will be an</p>
<p t="453000" d="6000">approximation formula for delta.
It will be the linear</p>
<p t="459000" d="5000">approximation,
a tangent plane approximation.</p>
<p t="464000" d="8000">What we can do -- Well,
let me start first with maybe</p>
<p t="472000" d="8000">something even before that.
The first thing that it does is</p>
<p t="480000" d="10000">it can encode how changes in x,
y, z affect the value of f.</p>
<p t="490000" d="5000">I would say that is the most
general answer to what is this</p>
<p t="495000" d="3000">formula, what are these
differentials.</p>
<p t="498000" d="6000">It is a relation between x,
y, z and f.</p>
<p t="504000" d="12000">And this is a placeholder for
small variations,</p>
<p t="516000" d="17000">delta x, delta y and delta z to
get an approximation formula.</p>
<p t="533000" d="7000">Which is delta f is
approximately equal to fx delta</p>
<p t="540000" d="6000">x fy delta y fz delta z.
It is getting cramped,</p>
<p t="546000" d="5000">but I am sure you know what is
going on here.</p>
<p t="551000" d="4000">And observe how this one is
actually equal while that one is</p>
<p t="555000" d="4000">approximately equal.
So they are really not the same.</p>
<p t="559000" d="3000">Another thing that the notation
suggests we can do,</p>
<p t="562000" d="4000">and they claim we can do,
is divide everything by some</p>
<p t="566000" d="3000">variable that everybody depends
on.</p>
<p t="569000" d="4000">Say, for example,
that x, y and z actually depend</p>
<p t="573000" d="6000">on some parameter t then they
will vary, at a certain rate,</p>
<p t="579000" d="3000">dx over dt, dy over dt,
dz over dt.</p>
<p t="582000" d="4000">And what the differential will
tell us then is the rate of</p>
<p t="586000" d="5000">change of f as a function of t,
when you plug in these values</p>
<p t="591000" d="6000">of x, y, z,
you will get df over dt by</p>
<p t="597000" d="8000">dividing everything by dt in
here.</p>
<p t="605000" d="16000">The first thing we can do is
divide by something like dt to</p>
<p t="621000" d="9000">get infinitesimal rate of
change.</p>
<p t="630000" d="13000">Well, let me just say rate of
change.</p>
<p t="643000" d="9000">df over dt equals f sub x dx
over dt plus f sub y dy over dt</p>
<p t="652000" d="8000">plus f sub z dz over dt.
And that corresponds to the</p>
<p t="660000" d="9000">situation where x is a function
of t, y is a function of t and z</p>
<p t="669000" d="5000">is a function of t.
That means you can plug in</p>
<p t="674000" d="4000">these values into f to get,
well, the value of f will</p>
<p t="678000" d="5000">depend on t,
and then you can find the rate</p>
<p t="683000" d="4000">of change with t of a value of
f.</p>
<p t="687000" d="8000">These are the basic rules.
And this is known as the chain</p>
<p t="695000" d="3000">rule.
It is one instance of a chain</p>
<p t="698000" d="2000">rule,
which tells you when you have a</p>
<p t="700000" d="2000">function that depends on
something,</p>
<p t="702000" d="3000">and that something in turn
depends on something else,</p>
<p t="705000" d="6000">how to find the rate of change
of a function on the new</p>
<p t="711000" d="5000">variable in terms of the
derivatives of a function and</p>
<p t="716000" d="5000">also the dependence between the
various variables.</p>
<p t="721000" d="7000">Any questions so far?
No.</p>
<p t="728000" d="3000">OK.
A word of warming,</p>
<p t="731000" d="4000">in particular,
about what I said up here.</p>
<p t="735000" d="4000">It is kind of unfortunate,
but the textbook actually has a</p>
<p t="739000" d="4000">serious mistake on that.
I mean they do have a couple of</p>
<p t="743000" d="6000">formulas where they mix a d with
a delta, and I warn you not to</p>
<p t="749000" d="3000">do that, please.
I mean there are d's and there</p>
<p t="752000" d="2000">are delta's, and basically they
don't live in the same world.</p>
<p t="754000" d="19000">They don't see each other.
The textbook is lying to you.</p>
<p t="773000" d="6000">Let's see.
The first and the second</p>
<p t="779000" d="2000">claims,
I don't really need to justify</p>
<p t="781000" d="4000">because the first one is just
stating some general principle,</p>
<p t="785000" d="3000">but I am not making a precise
mathematical claim.</p>
<p t="788000" d="3000">The second one,
well, we know the approximation</p>
<p t="791000" d="3000">formula already,
so I don't need to justify it</p>
<p t="794000" d="2000">for you.
But, on the other hand,</p>
<p t="796000" d="4000">this formula here,
I mean, you probably have a</p>
<p t="800000" d="4000">right to expect some reason for
why this works.</p>
<p t="804000" d="3000">Why is this valid?
After all, I first told you we</p>
<p t="807000" d="2000">have these new mysterious
objects.</p>
<p t="809000" d="3000">And then I am telling you we
can do that, but I kind of</p>
<p t="812000" d="12000">pulled it out of my hat.
I mean I don't have a hat.</p>
<p t="824000" d="9000">Why is this valid?
How can I get to this?</p>
<p t="833000" d="13000">Here is a first attempt of
justifying how to get there.</p>
<p t="846000" d="7000">Let's see.
Well, we said df is f sub x dx</p>
<p t="853000" d="12000">plus f sub y dy plus f sub z dz.
But we know if x is a function</p>
<p t="865000" d="12000">of t then dx is x prime of t dt,
dy is y prime of t dt,</p>
<p t="877000" d="10000">dz is z prime of t dt.
If we plug these into that</p>
<p t="887000" d="11000">formula, we will get that df is
f sub x times x prime t dt plus</p>
<p t="898000" d="10000">f sub y y prime of t dt plus f
sub z z prime of t dt.</p>
<p t="908000" d="6000">And now I have a relation
between df and dt.</p>
<p t="914000" d="3000">See, I got df equals sometimes
times dt.</p>
<p t="917000" d="6000">That means the rate of change
of f with respect to t should be</p>
<p t="923000" d="15000">that coefficient.
If I divide by dt then I get</p>
<p t="938000" d="8000">the chain rule.
That kind of works,</p>
<p t="946000" d="3000">but that shouldn't be
completely satisfactory.</p>
<p t="949000" d="4000">Let's say that you are a true
skeptic and you don't believe in</p>
<p t="953000" d="4000">differentials yet then it is
maybe not very good that I</p>
<p t="957000" d="4000">actually used more of these
differential notations in</p>
<p t="961000" d="4000">deriving the answer.
That is actually not how it is</p>
<p t="965000" d="3000">proved.
The way in which you prove the</p>
<p t="968000" d="5000">chain rule is not this way
because we shouldn't have too</p>
<p t="973000" d="3000">much trust in differentials just
yet.</p>
<p t="976000" d="2000">I mean at the end of today's
lecture, yes,</p>
<p t="978000" d="2000">probably we should believe in
them,</p>
<p t="980000" d="6000">but so far we should be a
little bit reluctant to believe</p>
<p t="986000" d="6000">these kind of strange objects
telling us weird things.</p>
<p t="992000" d="7000">Here is a better way to think
about it.</p>
<p t="999000" d="4000">One thing that we have trust in
so far are approximation</p>
<p t="1003000" d="5000">formulas.
We should have trust in them.</p>
<p t="1008000" d="6000">We should believe that if we
change x a little bit,</p>
<p t="1014000" d="8000">if we change y a little bit
then we are actually going to</p>
<p t="1022000" d="9000">get a change in f that is
approximately given by these</p>
<p t="1031000" d="2000">guys.
And this is true for any</p>
<p t="1033000" d="1000">changes in x,
y, z,</p>
<p t="1034000" d="6000">but in particular let's look at
the changes that we get if we</p>
<p t="1040000" d="6000">just take these formulas as
function of time and change time</p>
<p t="1046000" d="6000">a little bit by delta t.
We will actually use the</p>
<p t="1052000" d="7000">changes in x,
y, z in a small time delta t.</p>
<p t="1059000" d="8000">Let's divide everybody by delta
t.</p>
<p t="1067000" d="5000">Here I am just dividing numbers
so I am not actually playing any</p>
<p t="1072000" d="2000">tricks on you.
I mean we don't really know</p>
<p t="1074000" d="3000">what it means to divide
differentials,</p>
<p t="1077000" d="2000">but dividing numbers is
something we know.</p>
<p t="1079000" d="12000">And now, if I take delta t very
small, this guy tends to the</p>
<p t="1091000" d="8000">derivative, df over dt.
Remember, the definition of df</p>
<p t="1099000" d="4000">over dt is the limit of this
ratio when the time interval</p>
<p t="1103000" d="5000">delta t tends to zero.
That means if I choose smaller</p>
<p t="1108000" d="4000">and smaller values of delta t
then these ratios of numbers</p>
<p t="1112000" d="3000">will actually tend to some
value,</p>
<p t="1115000" d="6000">and that value is the
derivative.</p>
<p t="1121000" d="10000">Similarly, here delta x over
delta t, when delta t is really</p>
<p t="1131000" d="8000">small, will tend to the
derivative dx/dt.</p>
<p t="1139000" d="1000">And similarly for the others.</p>
<p t="1158000" d="10000">That means, in particular,
we take the limit as delta t</p>
<p t="1168000" d="7000">tends to zero and we get df over
dt on one side and on the other</p>
<p t="1175000" d="7000">side we get f sub x dx over dt
plus f sub y dy over dt plus f</p>
<p t="1182000" d="4000">sub z dz over dt.
And the approximation becomes</p>
<p t="1186000" d="3000">better and better.
Remember when we write</p>
<p t="1189000" d="4000">approximately equal that means
it is not quite the same,</p>
<p t="1193000" d="4000">but if we take smaller
variations then actually we will</p>
<p t="1197000" d="4000">end up with values that are
closer and closer.</p>
<p t="1201000" d="3000">When we take the limit,
as delta t tends to zero,</p>
<p t="1204000" d="2000">eventually we get an equality.</p>
<p t="1221000" d="3000">I mean mathematicians have more
complicated words to justify</p>
<p t="1224000" d="4000">this statement.
I will spare them for now,</p>
<p t="1228000" d="8000">and you will see them when you
take analysis if you go in that</p>
<p t="1236000" d="6000">direction.
Any questions so far?</p>
<p t="1242000" d="4000">No.
OK.</p>
<p t="1246000" d="1000">Let's check this with an
example.</p>
<p t="1247000" d="11000">Let's say that we really don't
have any faith in these things</p>
<p t="1258000" d="8000">so let's try to do it.
Let's say I give you a function</p>
<p t="1266000" d="8000">that is x ^2 y z.
And let's say that maybe x will</p>
<p t="1274000" d="6000">be t, y will be e^t and z will
be sin(t).</p>
<p t="1294000" d="6000">What does the chain rule say?
Well, the chain rule tells us</p>
<p t="1300000" d="6000">that dw/dt is,
we start with partial w over</p>
<p t="1306000" d="5000">partial x, well,
what is that?</p>
<p t="1311000" d="7000">That is 2xy,
and maybe I should point out</p>
<p t="1318000" d="10000">that this is w sub x,
times dx over dt plus -- Well,</p>
<p t="1328000" d="13000">w sub y is x squared times dy
over dt plus w sub z,</p>
<p t="1341000" d="7000">which is going to be just one,
dz over dt.</p>
<p t="1348000" d="5000">And so now let's plug in the
actual values of these things.</p>
<p t="1353000" d="5000">x is t and y is e^t,
so that will be 2t e to the t,</p>
<p t="1358000" d="9000">dx over dt is one plus x
squared is t squared,</p>
<p t="1367000" d="13000">dy over dt is e over t,
plus dz over dt is cosine t.</p>
<p t="1380000" d="6000">At the end of calculation we
get 2t e to the t plus t squared</p>
<p t="1386000" d="5000">e to the t plus cosine t.
That is what the chain rule</p>
<p t="1391000" d="5000">tells us.
How else could we find that?</p>
<p t="1396000" d="4000">Well, we could just plug in
values of x, y and z,</p>
<p t="1400000" d="3000">x plus w is a function of t,
and take its derivative.</p>
<p t="1403000" d="3000">Let's do that just for
verification.</p>
<p t="1406000" d="4000">It should be exactly the same
answer.</p>
<p t="1410000" d="2000">And, in fact,
in this case,</p>
<p t="1412000" d="3000">the two calculations are
roughly equal in complication.</p>
<p t="1415000" d="4000">But say that your function of
x, y, z was much more</p>
<p t="1419000" d="4000">complicated than that,
or maybe you actually didn't</p>
<p t="1423000" d="2000">know a formula for it,
you only knew its partial</p>
<p t="1425000" d="3000">derivatives,
then you would need to use the</p>
<p t="1428000" d="3000">chain rule.
So, sometimes plugging in</p>
<p t="1431000" d="3000">values is easier but not always.</p>
<p t="1453000" d="5000">Let's just check quickly.
The other method would be to</p>
<p t="1458000" d="5000">substitute.
W as a function of t.</p>
<p t="1463000" d="13000">Remember w was x^2y z.
x was t, so you get t squared,</p>
<p t="1476000" d="5000">y is e to the t,
plus z was sine t.</p>
<p t="1481000" d="6000">dw over dt, we know how to take
the derivative using single</p>
<p t="1487000" d="3000">variable calculus.
Well, we should know.</p>
<p t="1490000" d="5000">If we don't know then we should
take a look at 18.01 again.</p>
<p t="1495000" d="7000">The product rule that will be
derivative of t squared is 2t</p>
<p t="1502000" d="6000">times e to the t plus t squared
time the derivative of e to the</p>
<p t="1508000" d="8000">t is e to the t plus cosine t.
And that is the same answer as</p>
<p t="1516000" d="3000">over there.
I ended up writing,</p>
<p t="1519000" d="4000">you know, maybe I wrote
slightly more here,</p>
<p t="1523000" d="5000">but actually the amount of
calculations really was pretty</p>
<p t="1528000" d="4000">much the same.
Any questions about that?</p>
<p t="1532000" d="7000">Yes?
What kind of object is w?</p>
<p t="1539000" d="4000">Well, you can think of w as
just another variable that is</p>
<p t="1543000" d="4000">given as a function of x,
y and z, for example.</p>
<p t="1547000" d="4000">You would have a function of x,
y, z defined by this formula,</p>
<p t="1551000" d="6000">and I call it w.
I call its value w so that I</p>
<p t="1557000" d="7000">can substitute t instead of x,
y, z.</p>
<p t="1564000" d="3000">Well, let's think of w as a
function of three variables.</p>
<p t="1567000" d="5000">And then, when I plug in the
dependents of these three</p>
<p t="1572000" d="5000">variables on t,
then it becomes just a function</p>
<p t="1577000" d="2000">of t.
I mean, really,</p>
<p t="1579000" d="4000">my w here is pretty much what I
called f before.</p>
<p t="1583000" d="8000">There is no major difference
between the two.</p>
<p t="1591000" d="7000">Any other questions?
No.</p>
<p t="1598000" d="7000">OK.
Let's see.</p>
<p t="1605000" d="4000">Here is an application of what
we have seen.</p>
<p t="1609000" d="4000">Let's say that you want to
understand actually all these</p>
<p t="1613000" d="4000">rules about taking derivatives
in single variable calculus.</p>
<p t="1617000" d="3000">What I showed you at the
beginning, and then erased,</p>
<p t="1620000" d="4000">basically justifies how to take
the derivative of a reciprocal</p>
<p t="1624000" d="2000">function.
And for that you didn't need</p>
<p t="1626000" d="4000">multivariable calculus.
But let's try to justify the</p>
<p t="1630000" d="2000">product rule,
for example,</p>
<p t="1632000" d="9000">for the derivative.
An application of this actually</p>
<p t="1641000" d="10000">is to justify the product and
quotient rules.</p>
<p t="1651000" d="2000">Let's think,
for example,</p>
<p t="1653000" d="6000">of a function of two variables,
u and v, that is just the</p>
<p t="1659000" d="5000">product uv.
And let's say that u and v are</p>
<p t="1664000" d="4000">actually functions of one
variable t.</p>
<p t="1668000" d="12000">Then, well, d of uv over dt is
given by the chain rule applied</p>
<p t="1680000" d="4000">to f.
This is df over dt.</p>
<p t="1684000" d="11000">So df over dt should be f sub q
du over dt plus f sub v plus dv</p>
<p t="1695000" d="4000">over dt.
But now what is the partial of</p>
<p t="1699000" d="4000">f with respect to u?
It is v.</p>
<p t="1703000" d="8000">That is v du over dt.
And partial of f with respect</p>
<p t="1711000" d="7000">to v is going to be just u,
dv over dt.</p>
<p t="1718000" d="4000">So you get back the usual
product rule.</p>
<p t="1722000" d="4000">That is a slightly complicated
way of deriving it,</p>
<p t="1726000" d="4000">but that is a valid way of
understanding how to take the</p>
<p t="1730000" d="4000">derivative of a product by
thinking of the product first as</p>
<p t="1734000" d="3000">a function of variables,
which are u and v.</p>
<p t="1737000" d="3000">And then say,
oh, but u and v were actually</p>
<p t="1740000" d="3000">functions of a variable t.
And then you do the</p>
<p t="1743000" d="5000">differentiation in two stages
using the chain rule.</p>
<p t="1748000" d="8000">Similarly, you can do the
quotient rule just for practice.</p>
<p t="1756000" d="5000">If I give you the function g
equals u of v.</p>
<p t="1761000" d="4000">Right now I am thinking of it
as a function of two variables,</p>
<p t="1765000" d="4000">u and v.
U and v themselves are actually</p>
<p t="1769000" d="10000">going to be functions of t.
Then, well, dg over dt is going</p>
<p t="1779000" d="5000">to be partial g,
partial u.</p>
<p t="1784000" d="4000">How much is that?
How much is partial g,</p>
<p t="1788000" d="5000">partial u?
One over v times du over dt</p>
<p t="1793000" d="5000">plus -- Well,
next we need to have partial g</p>
<p t="1798000" d="3000">over partial v.
Well, what is the derivative of</p>
<p t="1801000" d="3000">this with respect to v?
Here we need to know how to</p>
<p t="1804000" d="7000">differentiate the inverse.
It is minus u over v squared</p>
<p t="1811000" d="9000">times dv over dt.
And that is actually the usual</p>
<p t="1820000" d="8000">quotient rule just written in a
slightly different way.</p>
<p t="1828000" d="2000">I mean, just in case you really
want to see it,</p>
<p t="1830000" d="6000">if you clear denominators for v
squared then you will see</p>
<p t="1836000" d="5000">basically u prime times v minus
v prime times u.</p>
<p t="1885000" d="7000">Now let's go to something even
more crazy.</p>
<p t="1892000" d="13000">I claim we can do chain rules
with more variables.</p>
<p t="1905000" d="5000">Let's say that I have a
quantity.</p>
<p t="1910000" d="5000">Let's call it w for now.
Let's say I have quantity w as</p>
<p t="1915000" d="3000">a function of say variables x
and y.</p>
<p t="1918000" d="4000">And so in the previous setup x
and y depended on some</p>
<p t="1922000" d="2000">parameters t.
But, actually,</p>
<p t="1924000" d="3000">let's now look at the case
where x and y themselves are</p>
<p t="1927000" d="3000">functions of several variables.
Let's say of two more variables.</p>
<p t="1930000" d="15000">Let's call them u and v.
I am going to stay with these</p>
<p t="1945000" d="2000">abstract letters,
but if it bothers you,</p>
<p t="1947000" d="4000">if it sounds completely
unmotivated think about it maybe</p>
<p t="1951000" d="2000">in terms of something you might
now.</p>
<p t="1953000" d="3000">Say, polar coordinates.
Let's say that I have a</p>
<p t="1956000" d="4000">function but is defined in terms
of the polar coordinate</p>
<p t="1960000" d="3000">variables on theta.
And then I know I want to</p>
<p t="1963000" d="2000">switch to usual coordinates x
and y.</p>
<p t="1965000" d="4000">Or, the other way around,
I have a function of x and y</p>
<p t="1969000" d="4000">and I want to express it in
terms of the polar coordinates r</p>
<p t="1973000" d="4000">and theta.
Then I would want to know maybe</p>
<p t="1977000" d="5000">how the derivatives,
with respect to the various</p>
<p t="1982000" d="5000">sets of variables,
related to each other.</p>
<p t="1987000" d="3000">One way I could do it is,
of course,</p>
<p t="1990000" d="6000">to say now if I plug the
formula for x and the formula</p>
<p t="1996000" d="7000">for y into the formula for f
then w becomes a function of u</p>
<p t="2003000" d="4000">and v,
and it can try to take partial</p>
<p t="2007000" d="2000">derivatives.
If I have explicit formulas,</p>
<p t="2009000" d="3000">well, that could work.
But maybe the formulas are</p>
<p t="2012000" d="3000">complicated.
Typically, if I switch between</p>
<p t="2015000" d="2000">rectangular and polar
coordinates,</p>
<p t="2017000" d="4000">there might be inverse trig,
there might be maybe arctangent</p>
<p t="2021000" d="4000">to express the polar angle in
terms of x and y.</p>
<p t="2025000" d="6000">And when I don't really want to
actually substitute arctangents</p>
<p t="2031000" d="5000">everywhere, maybe I would rather
deal with the derivatives.</p>
<p t="2036000" d="7000">How do I do that?
The question is what are</p>
<p t="2043000" d="8000">partial w over partial u and
partial w over partial v in</p>
<p t="2051000" d="6000">terms of, let's see,
what do we need to know to</p>
<p t="2057000" d="5000">understand that?
Well, probably we should know</p>
<p t="2062000" d="6000">how w depends on x and y.
If we don't know that then we</p>
<p t="2068000" d="4000">are probably toast.
Partial w over partial x,</p>
<p t="2072000" d="4000">partial w over partial y should
be required.</p>
<p t="2076000" d="3000">What else should we know?
Well, it would probably help to</p>
<p t="2079000" d="3000">know how x and y depend on u and
v.</p>
<p t="2082000" d="4000">If we don't know that then we
don't really know how to do it.</p>
<p t="2086000" d="9000">We need also x sub u,
x sub v, y sub u,</p>
<p t="2095000" d="5000">y sub v.
We have a lot of partials in</p>
<p t="2100000" d="7000">there.
Well, let's see how we can do</p>
<p t="2107000" d="6000">that.
Let's start by writing dw.</p>
<p t="2113000" d="6000">We know that dw is partial f,
well, I don't know why I have</p>
<p t="2119000" d="6000">two names, w and f.
I mean w and f are really the</p>
<p t="2125000" d="5000">same thing here,
but let's say f sub x dx plus f</p>
<p t="2130000" d="5000">sub y dy.
So far that is our new friend,</p>
<p t="2135000" d="4000">the differential.
Now what do we want to do with</p>
<p t="2139000" d="3000">it?
Well, we would like to get rid</p>
<p t="2142000" d="5000">of dx and dy because we like to
express things in terms of,</p>
<p t="2147000" d="3000">you know, the question we are
asking ourselves is let's say</p>
<p t="2150000" d="5000">that I change u a little bit,
how does w change?</p>
<p t="2155000" d="3000">Of course, what happens,
if I change u a little bit,</p>
<p t="2158000" d="3000">is y and y will change.
How do they change?</p>
<p t="2161000" d="4000">Well, that is given to me by
the differential.</p>
<p t="2165000" d="8000">dx is going to be,
well, I can use the</p>
<p t="2173000" d="6000">differential again.
Well, x is a function of u and</p>
<p t="2179000" d="5000">v.
That will be x sub u times du</p>
<p t="2184000" d="4000">plus x sub v times dv.
That is, again,</p>
<p t="2188000" d="3000">taking the differential of a
function of two variables.</p>
<p t="2191000" d="6000">Does that make sense?
And then we have the other guy,</p>
<p t="2197000" d="2000">f sub y times,
what is dy?</p>
<p t="2199000" d="10000">Well, similarly dy is y sub u
du plus y sub v dv.</p>
<p t="2209000" d="5000">And now we have a relation
between dw and du and dv.</p>
<p t="2214000" d="6000">We are expressing how w reacts
to changes in u and v,</p>
<p t="2220000" d="4000">which was our goal.
Now, let's actually collect</p>
<p t="2224000" d="4000">terms so that we see it a bit
better.</p>
<p t="2228000" d="11000">It is going to be f sub x times
x sub u times f sub y times y</p>
<p t="2239000" d="9000">sub u du plus f sub x,
x sub v plus f sub y y sub v</p>
<p t="2248000" d="4000">dv.
Now we have dw equals something</p>
<p t="2252000" d="6000">du plus something dv.
Well, the coefficient here has</p>
<p t="2258000" d="6000">to be partial f over partial u.
What else could it be?</p>
<p t="2264000" d="5000">That's the rate of change of w
with respect to u if I forget</p>
<p t="2269000" d="5000">what happens when I change v.
That is the definition of a</p>
<p t="2274000" d="4000">partial.
Similarly, this one has to be</p>
<p t="2278000" d="6000">partial f over partial v.
That is because it is the rate</p>
<p t="2284000" d="5000">of change with respect to v,
if I keep u constant,</p>
<p t="2289000" d="4000">so that these guys are
completely ignored.</p>
<p t="2293000" d="3000">Now you see how the total
differential accounts for,</p>
<p t="2296000" d="5000">somehow, all the partial
derivatives that come as</p>
<p t="2301000" d="6000">coefficients of the individual
variables in these expressions.</p>
<p t="2307000" d="6000">Let me maybe rewrite these
formulas in a more visible way</p>
<p t="2313000" d="7000">and then re-explain them to you.
Here is the chain rule for this</p>
<p t="2320000" d="6000">situation, with two intermediate
variables and two variables that</p>
<p t="2326000" d="4000">you express these in terms of.
In our setting,</p>
<p t="2330000" d="6000">we get partial f over partial u
equals partial f over partial x</p>
<p t="2336000" d="6000">time partial x over partial u
plus partial f over partial y</p>
<p t="2342000" d="6000">times partial y over partial u.
And the other one,</p>
<p t="2348000" d="7000">the same thing with v instead
of u,</p>
<p t="2355000" d="7000">partial f over partial x times
partial x over partial v plus</p>
<p t="2362000" d="6000">partial f over partial u partial
y over partial v.</p>
<p t="2368000" d="3000">I have to explain various
things about these formulas</p>
<p t="2371000" d="3000">because they look complicated.
And, actually,</p>
<p t="2374000" d="5000">they are not that complicated.
A couple of things to know.</p>
<p t="2379000" d="3000">The first thing,
how do we remember a formula</p>
<p t="2382000" d="2000">like that?
Well, that is easy.</p>
<p t="2384000" d="3000">We want to know how f depends
on u.</p>
<p t="2387000" d="4000">Well, what does f depend on?
It depends on x and y.</p>
<p t="2391000" d="4000">So we will put partial f over
partial x and partial f over</p>
<p t="2395000" d="4000">partial y.
Now, x and y, why are they here?</p>
<p t="2399000" d="2000">Well, they are here because
they actually depend on u as</p>
<p t="2401000" d="3000">well.
How does x depend on u?</p>
<p t="2404000" d="2000">Well, the answer is partial x
over partial u.</p>
<p t="2406000" d="4000">How does y depend on u?
The answer is partial y over</p>
<p t="2410000" d="2000">partial u.
See, the structure of this</p>
<p t="2412000" d="4000">formula is simple.
To find the partial of f with</p>
<p t="2416000" d="4000">respect to some new variable you
use the partials with respect to</p>
<p t="2420000" d="4000">the variables that f was
initially defined in terms of x</p>
<p t="2424000" d="4000">and y.
And you multiply them by the</p>
<p t="2428000" d="5000">partials of x and y in terms of
the new variable that you want</p>
<p t="2433000" d="4000">to look at, v here,
and you sum these things</p>
<p t="2437000" d="3000">together.
That is the structure of the</p>
<p t="2440000" d="2000">formula.
Why does it work?</p>
<p t="2442000" d="3000">Well, let me explain it to you
in a slightly different</p>
<p t="2445000" d="4000">language.
This asks us how does f change</p>
<p t="2449000" d="5000">if I change u a little bit?
Well, why would f change if u</p>
<p t="2454000" d="3000">changes a little bit?
Well, it would change because f</p>
<p t="2457000" d="3000">actually depends on x and y and
x and y depend on u.</p>
<p t="2460000" d="3000">If I change u,
how quickly does x change?</p>
<p t="2463000" d="3000">Well, the answer is partial x
over partial u.</p>
<p t="2466000" d="3000">And now, if I change x at this
rate, how does that have to</p>
<p t="2469000" d="4000">change?
Well, the answer is partial f</p>
<p t="2473000" d="4000">over partial x times this guy.
Well, at the same time,</p>
<p t="2477000" d="4000">y is also changing.
How fast is y changing if I</p>
<p t="2481000" d="3000">change u?
Well, at the rate of partial y</p>
<p t="2484000" d="3000">over partial u.
But now if I change this how</p>
<p t="2487000" d="3000">does f change?
Well, the rate of change is</p>
<p t="2490000" d="4000">partial f over partial y.
The product is the effect of</p>
<p t="2494000" d="3000">how you change it,
changing u, and therefore</p>
<p t="2497000" d="3000">changing f.
Now, what happens in real life,</p>
<p t="2500000" d="3000">if I change u a little bit?
Well, both x and y change at</p>
<p t="2503000" d="3000">the same time.
So how does f change?</p>
<p t="2506000" d="4000">Well, it is the sum of the two
effects.</p>
<p t="2510000" d="4000">Does that make sense?
Good.</p>
<p t="2514000" d="6000">Of course, if f depends on more
variables then you just have</p>
<p t="2520000" d="2000">more terms in here.
OK.</p>
<p t="2522000" d="3000">Here is another thing that may
be a little bit confusing.</p>
<p t="2525000" d="4000">What is tempting?
Well, what is tempting here</p>
<p t="2529000" d="3000">would be to simplify these
formulas by removing these</p>
<p t="2532000" d="3000">partial x's.
Let's simplify by partial x.</p>
<p t="2535000" d="3000">Let's simplify by partial y.
We get partial f over partial u</p>
<p t="2538000" d="3000">equals partial f over partial u
plus partial f over partial u.</p>
<p t="2541000" d="4000">Something is not working
properly.</p>
<p t="2545000" d="3000">Why doesn't it work?
The answer is precisely because</p>
<p t="2548000" d="4000">these are partial derivatives.
These are not total derivatives.</p>
<p t="2552000" d="4000">And so you cannot simplify them
in that way.</p>
<p t="2556000" d="3000">And that is actually the reason
why we use this curly d rather</p>
<p t="2559000" d="2000">than a straight d.
It is to remind us,</p>
<p t="2561000" d="3000">beware, there are these
simplifications that we can do</p>
<p t="2564000" d="3000">with straight d's that are not
legal here.</p>
<p t="2567000" d="5000">Somehow, when you have a
partial derivative,</p>
<p t="2572000" d="5000">you must resist the urge of
simplifying things.</p>
<p t="2577000" d="5000">No simplifications in here.
That is the simplest formula</p>
<p t="2582000" d="8000">you can get.
Any questions at this point?</p>
<p t="2590000" d="11000">No.
Yes?</p>
<p t="2601000" d="2000">When would you use this and
what does it describe?</p>
<p t="2603000" d="3000">Well, it is basically when you
have a function given in terms</p>
<p t="2606000" d="3000">of a certain set of variables
because maybe there is a simply</p>
<p t="2609000" d="2000">expression in terms of those
variables.</p>
<p t="2611000" d="4000">But ultimately what you care
about is not those variables,</p>
<p t="2615000" d="4000">z and y, but another set of
variables, here u and v.</p>
<p t="2619000" d="3000">So x and y are giving you a
nice formula for f,</p>
<p t="2622000" d="4000">but actually the relevant
variables for your problem are u</p>
<p t="2626000" d="2000">and v.
And you know x and y are</p>
<p t="2628000" d="2000">related to u and v.
So, of course,</p>
<p t="2630000" d="3000">what you could do is plug the
formulas the way that we did</p>
<p t="2633000" d="2000">substituting.
But maybe that will give you</p>
<p t="2635000" d="4000">very complicated expressions.
And maybe it is actually easier</p>
<p t="2639000" d="3000">to just work with the derivates.
The important claim here is</p>
<p t="2642000" d="3000">basically we don't need to know
the actual formulas.</p>
<p t="2645000" d="2000">All we need to know are the
rate of changes.</p>
<p t="2647000" d="4000">If we know all these rates of
change then we know how to take</p>
<p t="2651000" d="3000">these derivatives without
actually having to plug in</p>
<p t="2654000" d="8000">values.
Yes?</p>
<p t="2662000" d="3000">Yes, you could certain do the
same things in terms of t.</p>
<p t="2665000" d="4000">If x and y were functions of t
instead of being functions of u</p>
<p t="2669000" d="2000">and v then it would be the same
thing.</p>
<p t="2671000" d="3000">And you would have the same
formulas that I had,</p>
<p t="2674000" d="3000">well, over there I still have
it.</p>
<p t="2677000" d="2000">Why does that one have straight
d's?</p>
<p t="2679000" d="3000">Well, the answer is I could put
curly d's if I wanted,</p>
<p t="2682000" d="3000">but I end up with a function of
a single variable.</p>
<p t="2685000" d="3000">If you have a single variable
then the partial,</p>
<p t="2688000" d="2000">with respect to that variable,
is the same thing as the usual</p>
<p t="2690000" d="3000">derivative.
We don't actually need to worry</p>
<p t="2693000" d="4000">about curly in that case.
But that one is indeed special</p>
<p t="2697000" d="3000">case of this one where instead
of x and y depending on two</p>
<p t="2700000" d="3000">variables, u and v,
they depend on a single</p>
<p t="2703000" d="1000">variable t.
Now, of course,</p>
<p t="2704000" d="2000">you can call variables any name
you want.</p>
<p t="2706000" d="6000">It doesn't matter.
This is just a slight</p>
<p t="2712000" d="4000">generalization of that.
Well, not quite because here I</p>
<p t="2716000" d="2000">also had a z.
See, I am trying to just</p>
<p t="2718000" d="3000">confuse you by giving you
functions that depend on various</p>
<p t="2721000" d="4000">numbers of variables.
If you have a function of 30</p>
<p t="2725000" d="3000">variables, things work the same
way, just longer,</p>
<p t="2728000" d="5000">and you are going to run out of
letters in the alphabet before</p>
<p t="2733000" d="5000">the end.
Any other questions?</p>
<p t="2738000" d="5000">No.
What?</p>
<p t="2743000" d="8000">Yes?
If u and v themselves depended</p>
<p t="2751000" d="4000">on another variable then you
would continue with your chain</p>
<p t="2755000" d="3000">rules.
Maybe you would know to express</p>
<p t="2758000" d="4000">partial x over partial u in
terms using that chain rule.</p>
<p t="2762000" d="3000">Sorry.
If u and v are dependent on yet</p>
<p t="2765000" d="3000">another variable then you could
get the derivative with respect</p>
<p t="2768000" d="3000">to that using first the chain
rule to pass from u v to that</p>
<p t="2771000" d="3000">new variable,
and then you would plug in</p>
<p t="2774000" d="3000">these formulas for partials of f
with respect to u and v.</p>
<p t="2777000" d="2000">In fact, if you have several
substitutions to do,</p>
<p t="2779000" d="2000">you can always arrange to use
one chain rule at a time.</p>
<p t="2781000" d="4000">You just have to do them in
sequence.</p>
<p t="2785000" d="3000">That's why we don't actually
learn that, but you can just do</p>
<p t="2788000" d="4000">it be repeating the process.
I mean, probably at that stage,</p>
<p t="2792000" d="3000">the easiest to not get confused
actually is to manipulate</p>
<p t="2795000" d="3000">differentials because that is
probably easier.</p>
<p t="2798000" d="9000">Yes?
Curly f does not exist.</p>
<p t="2807000" d="3000">That's easy.
Curly f makes no sense by</p>
<p t="2810000" d="2000">itself.
It doesn't exist alone.</p>
<p t="2812000" d="6000">What exists is only curly df
over curly d some variable.</p>
<p t="2818000" d="4000">And then that accounts only for
the rate of change with respect</p>
<p t="2822000" d="3000">to that variable leaving the
others fixed,</p>
<p t="2825000" d="6000">while straight df is somehow a
total variation of f.</p>
<p t="2831000" d="5000">It accounts for all of the
partial derivatives and their</p>
<p t="2836000" d="9000">combined effects.
OK. Any more questions? No.</p>
<p t="2845000" d="4000">Let me just finish up very
quickly by telling you again one</p>
<p t="2849000" d="4000">example where completely you
might want to do this.</p>
<p t="2853000" d="7000">You have a function that you
want to switch between</p>
<p t="2860000" d="5000">rectangular and polar
coordinates.</p>
<p t="2865000" d="3000">To make things a little bit
concrete.</p>
<p t="2868000" d="7000">If you have polar coordinates
that means in the plane,</p>
<p t="2875000" d="5000">instead of using x and y,
you will use coordinates r,</p>
<p t="2880000" d="5000">distance to the origin,
and theta, the angles from the</p>
<p t="2885000" d="3000">x-axis.
The change of variables for</p>
<p t="2888000" d="6000">that is x equals r cosine theta
and y equals r sine theta.</p>
<p t="2894000" d="7000">And so that means if you have a
function f that depends on x and</p>
<p t="2901000" d="8000">y, in fact, you can plug these
in as a function of r and theta.</p>
<p t="2909000" d="5000">Then you can ask yourself,
well, what is partial f over</p>
<p t="2914000" d="3000">partial r?
And that is going to be,</p>
<p t="2917000" d="5000">well, you want to take partial
f over partial x times partial x</p>
<p t="2922000" d="6000">partial r plus partial f over
partial y times partial y over</p>
<p t="2928000" d="5000">partial r.
That will end up being actually</p>
<p t="2933000" d="6000">f sub x times cosine theta plus
f sub y times sine theta.</p>
<p t="2939000" d="3000">And you can do the same thing
to find partial f,</p>
<p t="2942000" d="3000">partial theta.
And so you can express</p>
<p t="2945000" d="5000">derivatives either in terms of
x, y or in terms of r and theta</p>
<p t="2950000" d="3000">with simple relations between
them.</p>
<p t="2953000" d="7000">And the one last thing I should
say.</p>
<p t="2960000" d="3000">On Thursday we will learn about
more tricks we can play with</p>
<p t="2963000" d="4000">variations of functions.
And one that is important,</p>
<p t="2967000" d="2000">because you need to know it
actually to do the p-set,</p>
<p t="2969000" d="9000">is the gradient vector.
The gradient vector is simply a</p>
<p t="2978000" d="3000">vector.
You use this downward pointing</p>
<p t="2981000" d="3000">triangle as the notation for the
gradient.</p>
<p t="2984000" d="5000">It is simply is a vector whose
components are the partial</p>
<p t="2989000" d="4000">derivatives of a function.
I mean, in a way,</p>
<p t="2993000" d="3000">you can think of a differential
as a way to package partial</p>
<p t="2996000" d="3000">derivatives together into some
weird object.</p>
<p t="2999000" d="2000">Well, the gradient is also a
way to package partials</p>
<p t="3001000" d="3000">together.
We will see on Thursday what it</p>
<p t="3004000" d="3000">is good for, but some of the
problems on the p-set use it.</p>
