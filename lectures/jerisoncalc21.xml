<p t="21420" d="2310">PROFESSOR: One correction
from last time.</p>
<p t="23730" d="4980">Sorry to say, I forgot a very
important factor when I was</p>
<p t="28710" d="2190">telling you what an
average value is.</p>
<p t="30900" d="4260">If you don't put in that factor,
it's only half off on</p>
<p t="35160" d="3680">the exam problem that will
be given on this.</p>
<p t="38840" d="3810">So I would have gotten half off
for missing out on this</p>
<p t="42650" d="1590">factor, too.</p>
<p t="44240" d="2950">So remember you have to divide
by n here, certainly when</p>
<p t="47190" d="2850">you're integrating over 0 to
n, the Riemann sum is the</p>
<p t="50040" d="1420">numerator here.</p>
<p t="51460" d="2380">And if I divide by n on that
side, I've got to divide by n</p>
<p t="53840" d="1410">on the other side.</p>
<p t="55250" d="3000">This was meant to illustrate
this idea that we're dividing</p>
<p t="58250" d="2290">by the total here.</p>
<p t="60540" d="1810">And we are going to be
talking about average</p>
<p t="62350" d="2950">value in more detail.</p>
<p t="65300" d="2390">Not today, though.</p>
<p t="67690" d="8500">So this has to do with
average value.</p>
<p t="76190" d="4750">And we'll discuss it in
considerable detail in a</p>
<p t="80940" d="6400">couple of days, I guess.</p>
<p t="87340" d="6560">Now, today I want to continue.</p>
<p t="93900" d="3790">I didn't have time to finish
my discussion of the</p>
<p t="97690" d="2210">Fundamental Theorem
of Calculus 2.</p>
<p t="99900" d="2210">And anyway it's very important
to write it down on the board</p>
<p t="102110" d="4300">twice, because you want to
see it at least twice.</p>
<p t="106410" d="1960">And many more times as well.</p>
<p t="108370" d="3440">So let's just remind you, the
second version of the</p>
<p t="111810" d="3620">Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
says the following.</p>
<p t="115430" d="6040">It says that the derivative of
an integral gives you the</p>
<p t="121470" d="2160">function back again.</p>
<p t="123630" d="4680">So here's the theorem.</p>
<p t="128310" d="4850">And the way I'd like to use
it today, I started this</p>
<p t="133160" d="1340">discussion last time.</p>
<p t="134500" d="2160">But we didn't get into it.</p>
<p t="136660" d="3460">And this is something that's on
your problem set along with</p>
<p t="140120" d="3070">several other examples.</p>
<p t="143190" d="7580">Is that we can use this to solve
differential equations.</p>
<p t="150770" d="6320">And in particular, for example,
we can solve the</p>
<p t="157090" d="6450">equation y' = 1 / x
with this formula.</p>
<p t="163540" d="4190">Namely, using an integral.</p>
<p t="167730" d="7040">L ( x ) is the integral
from 1 to x of dt / t.</p>
<p t="174770" d="5640">The function f ( t
) is just 1 / t.</p>
<p t="180410" d="8800">Now, that formula can be taken
to be the starting place for</p>
<p t="189210" d="1905">the derivation of all
the properties of</p>
<p t="191115" d="1395">the logarithm function.</p>
<p t="192510" d="2140">So what we're going to do right
now is we're going to</p>
<p t="194650" d="13540">take this to be the definition
of the logarithm.</p>
<p t="208190" d="3760">And if we do that, then I claim
that we can read off the</p>
<p t="211950" d="2560">properties of the logarithm
just about as easily as we</p>
<p t="214510" d="1640">could before.</p>
<p t="216150" d="2580">And so I'll illustrate
that now.</p>
<p t="218730" d="3610">And there are a few other
examples of this where</p>
<p t="222340" d="3110">somewhat more unfamiliar
functions come up.</p>
<p t="225450" d="5130">This one is one that in theory
we know something about.</p>
<p t="230580" d="2010">The first property of this
function is the one that's</p>
<p t="232590" d="1360">already given.</p>
<p t="233950" d="5630">Namely, its derivative
is 1 / x.</p>
<p t="239580" d="2250">And we get a lot of information
just out of the</p>
<p t="241830" d="2420">fact that its derivative
is 1 / x.</p>
<p t="244250" d="2190">The other thing that we need
in order to nail down the</p>
<p t="246440" d="3375">function, besides its
derivative, is one value of</p>
<p t="249815" d="465">the function.</p>
<p t="250280" d="4390">Because it's really not
specified by this equation,</p>
<p t="254670" d="2820">only specified up to a constant
by this equation.</p>
<p t="257490" d="2840">But we nail down that constant
when we evaluate it at this</p>
<p t="260330" d="2350">one place, L ( 1).</p>
<p t="262680" d="2680">And there we're getting the
integral from 1 to 1 of dt /</p>
<p t="265360" d="3070">t, which is 0.</p>
<p t="268430" d="2430">And that's the case with all
these definite integrals.</p>
<p t="270860" d="2140">If you evaluate them at their
starting places, the</p>
<p t="273000" d="1460">value will be 0.</p>
<p t="274460" d="2970">And together these two
properties specify this</p>
<p t="277430" d="5370">function L (x), uniquely.</p>
<p t="282800" d="4000">Now, the next step is to try
to think about what its</p>
<p t="286800" d="1060">properties are.</p>
<p t="287860" d="3730">And the first approach to that,
and this is the approach</p>
<p t="291590" d="3116">that we always take, is to maybe
graph the function, to</p>
<p t="294706" d="1164">get a feeling for it.</p>
<p t="295870" d="2100">And so I'm going to take
the second derivative.</p>
<p t="297970" d="2890">Now, notice that when you have
a function which is given as</p>
<p t="300860" d="1930">an integral, its first
derivative is</p>
<p t="302790" d="2140">really easy to compute.</p>
<p t="304930" d="1740">And then its second derivative,
well, you have to</p>
<p t="306670" d="1620">differentiate whatever
you get.</p>
<p t="308290" d="1430">So it may or may not be easy.</p>
<p t="309720" d="3160">But anyway, it's a lot harder in
the case when I start with</p>
<p t="312880" d="2270">a function to get to the
second derivative.</p>
<p t="315150" d="3920">Here it's relatively easy.</p>
<p t="319070" d="2580">And these are the properties
that I'm going to use.</p>
<p t="321650" d="4760">I won't really use very much
more about it than that.</p>
<p t="326410" d="3250">And qualitatively, the
conclusions that we can draw</p>
<p t="329660" d="3380">from this are, first of all,
from this, for example we see</p>
<p t="333040" d="5930">that this thing is concave
down every place.</p>
<p t="338970" d="2670">And then to get started with the
graph, since I see I have</p>
<p t="341640" d="5070">a value here, which is L( 1) =
0, I'm going to throw in the</p>
<p t="346710" d="1850">value of the slope.</p>
<p t="348560" d="3390">So L' ( 1), which I know is 1 of
1, that's reading off from</p>
<p t="351950" d="3230">this equation here,
so that's 1.</p>
<p t="355180" d="4020">And now I'm ready to sketch at
least a part of the curve.</p>
<p t="359200" d="8480">So here's a sketch
of the graph.</p>
<p t="367680" d="5320">Here's the point (1, 0);
that is, x = 1, y = 0.</p>
<p t="373000" d="4420">And the tangent line,
I know, has slope 1.</p>
<p t="377420" d="3120">And the curve is concave down.</p>
<p t="380540" d="6990">So it's going to look
something like this.</p>
<p t="387530" d="3700">Incidentally, it's
also increasing.</p>
<p t="391230" d="3730">And that's an important
property, it's strictly</p>
<p t="394960" d="440">increasing.</p>
<p t="395400" d="4170">That's because L' (
x) is positive.</p>
<p t="399570" d="3990">And so, we can get from this
the following important</p>
<p t="403560" d="660">definition.</p>
<p t="404220" d="1910">Which, again, is working
backwards from this</p>
<p t="406130" d="480">definition.</p>
<p t="406610" d="3010">We can get to where we started
with a log in our previous</p>
<p t="409620" d="1000">discussion.</p>
<p t="410620" d="7480">Namely, if I take the level
here, which is y = 1, then</p>
<p t="418100" d="1630">that crosses the
axis someplace.</p>
<p t="419730" d="4450">And his point is what we're
going to define as e.</p>
<p t="424180" d="8960">So the definition of e is
that it's the value such</p>
<p t="433140" d="7080">that L ( e) = 1.</p>
<p t="440220" d="2580">And again, the fact that there's
exactly one such place</p>
<p t="442800" d="3010">just comes from the fact that
this L' is positive, so that L</p>
<p t="445810" d="3530">is increasing.</p>
<p t="449340" d="4190">No, there's just one other
feature of this graph that I'm</p>
<p t="453530" d="2400">going to emphasize to you.</p>
<p t="455930" d="2500">There's one other thing which
I'm not going to check, which</p>
<p t="458430" d="1630">you would ordinarily
do with graphs.</p>
<p t="460060" d="1890">Once it's increasing there are
no critical points, so the</p>
<p t="461950" d="2280">only other interesting
thing is the n's.</p>
<p t="464230" d="2310">And it turns out that the limit
as you go down to 0 is</p>
<p t="466540" d="450">minus infinity.</p>
<p t="466990" d="2850">As you go over to the right
here it's plus infinity.</p>
<p t="469840" d="3500">It does get arbitrarily high;
it doesn't level off.</p>
<p t="473340" d="2480">But I'm not going to
discuss that here.</p>
<p t="475820" d="2580">Instead, I'm going to just
remark on one qualitative</p>
<p t="478400" d="4510">feature of the graph, which is
this remark that the part</p>
<p t="482910" d="3940">which is to the left
of 1 is below 0.</p>
<p t="486850" d="10500">So I just want to remark, why
is L (x) negative for x &lt; 1.</p>
<p t="497350" d="1840">Maybe I don't have room
for that, so I'll just</p>
<p t="499190" d="4360">put in here x &lt; 1.</p>
<p t="503550" d="1770">I want to give you
two reasons.</p>
<p t="505320" d="2660">Again, we're only working from
very first principles here.</p>
<p t="507980" d="5520">Just that the property that
L' = 1 / x, and L (1) = 0.</p>
<p t="513500" d="5890">So our first reason is that,
well, I just said it.</p>
<p t="519390" d="2040">L ( 1) = 0.</p>
<p t="521430" d="5480">And L is increasing.</p>
<p t="526910" d="2820">And if you read that backwards,
if it gets up to 0</p>
<p t="529730" d="4430">here, it must have been
negative before 0.</p>
<p t="534160" d="3800">So this is one way of seeing
that L ( x) is negative.</p>
<p t="537960" d="2190">There's a second way
of seeing it,</p>
<p t="540150" d="2260">which is equally important.</p>
<p t="542410" d="5060">And it has to do with just
manipulation of integrals.</p>
<p t="547470" d="3330">Here I'm going to start out
with L (x), and its</p>
<p t="550800" d="630">definition.</p>
<p t="551430" d="4300">Which is the integral
from 1 to x dt / t.</p>
<p t="555730" d="3520">And now I'm going to reverse
the order of integration.</p>
<p t="559250" d="2250">This is the same, by our
definition of our properties</p>
<p t="561500" d="2700">of integrals, as the integral
from x to 1 with a</p>
<p t="564200" d="5810">minus sign dt / t.</p>
<p t="570010" d="4130">Now, I can tell that this
quantity is negative.</p>
<p t="574140" d="5550">And the reason that I can tell
is that this chunk of it here,</p>
<p t="579690" d="4320">this piece of it, is
a positive number.</p>
<p t="584010" d="2280">This part is positive.</p>
<p t="586290" d="5000">And this part is positive
because x &lt; 1.</p>
<p t="591290" d="2450">So the lower limit is less than
the upper limit, and so</p>
<p t="593740" d="1000">this is interpreted.</p>
<p t="594740" d="3330">The thing in the green box is
interpreted as an area.</p>
<p t="598070" d="900">It's an area.</p>
<p t="598970" d="4150">And so negative a positive
quantity is negative, minus a</p>
<p t="603120" d="5160">positive quantity's negative.</p>
<p t="608280" d="4380">So both of these work
perfectly well as</p>
<p t="612660" d="1210">interpretations.</p>
<p t="613870" d="2140">And it's just to illustrate
what we can do.</p>
<p t="616010" d="2800">Now, there's one more
manipulation of integrals that</p>
<p t="618810" d="4570">gives us the fanciest
property of the ln.</p>
<p t="623380" d="3030">And that's the last one
that I'm going to do.</p>
<p t="626410" d="3040">And you have a similar thing
on your homework.</p>
<p t="629450" d="3470">So I'm going to prove that
this is, as I say, the</p>
<p t="632920" d="2050">fanciest property of the log.</p>
<p t="634970" d="4710">On your homework, by the way,
you're going to check that L(</p>
<p t="639680" d="7000">1 / x) = - L ( x).</p>
<p t="646680" d="5390">But we'll do this one.</p>
<p t="652070" d="2710">The idea is just to plug
in the formula</p>
<p t="654780" d="1650">and see what it gives.</p>
<p t="656430" d="6400">On the left-hand side, I
have 1 to ab, dt / t.</p>
<p t="662830" d="3210">That's L ( ab).</p>
<p t="666040" d="2860">And then that's certainly equal
to the left-hand side.</p>
<p t="668900" d="3750">And then I'm going to now split
this into two pieces.</p>
<p t="672650" d="1950">Again, this is a property
of integrals.</p>
<p t="674600" d="4470">That if you have an integral
from one place to another, you</p>
<p t="679070" d="1550">can break it up into pieces.</p>
<p t="680620" d="5920">So I'm going to start at
1 but then go to a.</p>
<p t="686540" d="7410">And then I'm going to continue
from a to ab.</p>
<p t="693950" d="2630">So this is the question
that we have. We</p>
<p t="696580" d="1430">haven't proved this.</p>
<p t="698010" d="3040">Well, this one is
actually true.</p>
<p t="701050" d="1830">If we want this to be
true, we know by</p>
<p t="702880" d="2020">definition L ( ab) is this.</p>
<p t="704900" d="3560">We know, we can see it,
that L(a) is this.</p>
<p t="708460" d="4570">So the question that this boils
down to is, we want to</p>
<p t="713030" d="1930">know that these two
things are equal.</p>
<p t="714960" d="6360">We want to know that L ( b) is
that other integral there.</p>
<p t="721320" d="3640">So let's check it.</p>
<p t="724960" d="1230">I'm going to rewrite
the integral.</p>
<p t="726190" d="3180">It's the integral from - sorry,
from lower limit a to</p>
<p t="729370" d="4570">upper limit ab of dt / t.</p>
<p t="733940" d="3430">And now, again, to illustrate
properties of integrals, the</p>
<p t="737370" d="3860">key property here that we're
going to have to use is change</p>
<p t="741230" d="2510">of variables.</p>
<p t="743740" d="3050">This is a kind of a scaled
integral where everything is</p>
<p t="746790" d="3200">multiplied by a factor of a from
what we want to get to</p>
<p t="749990" d="2020">this L ( b) quantity.</p>
<p t="752010" d="6230">And so this suggests that
we write down t = a u.</p>
<p t="758240" d="2220">That's going to be our trick.</p>
<p t="760460" d="2450">And if I use that new variable
u, then the change</p>
<p t="762910" d="7530">in t, dt, is adu.</p>
<p t="770440" d="3510">And as a result, I can write
this as equal to an integral</p>
<p t="773950" d="4060">from, let's see, dt = adu.</p>
<p t="778010" d="2070">And t = au.</p>
<p t="780080" d="5660">So I've now substituted
in for the integrand.</p>
<p t="785740" d="3470">But on top of this, with
definite integrals, we also</p>
<p t="789210" d="3870">have to check the limits.</p>
<p t="793080" d="4060">And the limits work
out as follows.</p>
<p t="797140" d="3040">When t = a, that's
the lower limit.</p>
<p t="800180" d="2280">Let's just take a
look. t = a u.</p>
<p t="802460" d="4140">So that means that u
is equal to, what?</p>
<p t="806600" d="2110">It's 1.</p>
<p t="808710" d="3170">Because a * 1 = a.</p>
<p t="811880" d="2160">So if t = a, this is
if and only if.</p>
<p t="814040" d="3055">So this lower limit, which
really in disguise was where t</p>
<p t="817095" d="8305">= a, becomes where u = 1.</p>
<p t="825400" d="8520">And similarly, when
t = ab, u = b.</p>
<p t="833920" d="2770">So the upper limit here is b.</p>
<p t="836690" d="5450">And now, if you notice, we're
just going to cancel these two</p>
<p t="842140" d="780">factors here.</p>
<p t="842920" d="4360">And now we recognize that this
is just the same as the</p>
<p t="847280" d="2660">definition of L ( b).</p>
<p t="849940" d="3550">Because L ( x) is over
here in the box.</p>
<p t="853490" d="2780">And the fact that I use the
letter t there is irrelevant;</p>
<p t="856270" d="1750">it works equally well
with the letter u.</p>
<p t="858020" d="4410">So this is just L (b).</p>
<p t="862430" d="10730">Which is what we
wanted to show.</p>
<p t="873160" d="2520">So that's an example, and you
have one in your homework,</p>
<p t="875680" d="9700">which is a little similar.</p>
<p t="885380" d="3410">Now, the last example, that I'm
going to discuss of this</p>
<p t="888790" d="2600">type, I already mentioned
last time.</p>
<p t="891390" d="3040">Which is the function F ( x),
which is the integral from 0</p>
<p t="894430" d="3720">to x of e ^ -t^2 dt.</p>
<p t="898150" d="5980">This one is even more exotic
because unlike the logarithm</p>
<p t="904130" d="1900">it's a new function.</p>
<p t="906030" d="4200">It really is not any function
that you can express in terms</p>
<p t="910230" d="3640">of the functions that
we know already.</p>
<p t="913870" d="4880">And the approach, always, to
these new functions is to</p>
<p t="918750" d="3250">think of what their
properties are.</p>
<p t="922000" d="2570">And the way we think of
functions in order to</p>
<p t="924570" d="2000">understand them is to
maybe sketch them.</p>
<p t="926570" d="1390">And so I'm going to do
exactly the same</p>
<p t="927960" d="1870">thing I did over here.</p>
<p t="929830" d="1800">So, what is it that I
can get out of this?</p>
<p t="931630" d="3475">Well, immediately I can figure
out what the derivative is.</p>
<p t="935105" d="2895">I read it off from the
fundamental theorem.</p>
<p t="938000" d="3610">It's this.</p>
<p t="941610" d="3860">I also can figure out the value
at the starting place.</p>
<p t="945470" d="2970">In this case, the starting
place is 0.</p>
<p t="948440" d="5550">And the value is 0.</p>
<p t="953990" d="3610">And I should check the second
derivative, which is also not</p>
<p t="957600" d="1545">so difficult to compute.</p>
<p t="959145" d="6925">The second derivative
is - 2x e ^ x^2.</p>
<p t="966070" d="4580">And so now I can see that this
function is increasing,</p>
<p t="970650" d="2650">because this derivative is
positive, it's always</p>
<p t="973300" d="1370">increasing.</p>
<p t="974670" d="3270">And it's going to be concave
down when x is positive and</p>
<p t="977940" d="2600">concave up when x is negative.</p>
<p t="980540" d="4360">Because there's a minus sign
here, so the sign is negative.</p>
<p t="984900" d="5350">This is less than 0 when x is
positive and greater than 0</p>
<p t="990250" d="6550">when x is negative.</p>
<p t="996800" d="3360">And maybe to get started I'll
remind you F( 0), 0.</p>
<p t="1000160" d="5060">It's also true that F' ( 0),
that just comes right out of</p>
<p t="1005220" d="7230">this, F' ( 0) = e ^
- 0^2 which is 1.</p>
<p t="1012450" d="2970">That means the tangent line
again has slope 1.</p>
<p t="1015420" d="1670">We do this a lot
with functions.</p>
<p t="1017090" d="3300">We normalize them so that their
slopes of their tangent</p>
<p t="1020390" d="3210">lines are 1 at convenient
spots.</p>
<p t="1023600" d="2790">So here's the tangent
line of slope 1.</p>
<p t="1026390" d="5150">We know this thing is concave
down to the right and concave</p>
<p t="1031540" d="3350">up to the left.</p>
<p t="1034890" d="2680">And so it's going to look
something like this.</p>
<p t="1037570" d="3290">With an inflection point.</p>
<p t="1040860" d="5430">Right?</p>
<p t="1046290" d="6240">Now, I want to say one more,
make one more remark about</p>
<p t="1052530" d="2060">this function, or maybe two
more remarks about this</p>
<p t="1054590" d="1460">function, before we go on.</p>
<p t="1056050" d="3180">Really, you want to know this
graph as well as possible.</p>
<p t="1059230" d="2990">And so there are just a
couple more features.</p>
<p t="1062220" d="3605">And one is enormously helpful
because it cuts in half all of</p>
<p t="1065825" d="3355">the work that you have. and
that is the property that</p>
<p t="1069180" d="2620">turns out that this
function is i.</p>
<p t="1071800" d="5060">Namely, F( - x) = - F(x).</p>
<p t="1076860" d="4190">That's what's known as
an odd function.</p>
<p t="1081050" d="5100">Now, the reason why it's
odd is that it's the</p>
<p t="1086150" d="2350">antiderivative of something
that's even.</p>
<p t="1088500" d="1930">This function in here is even.</p>
<p t="1090430" d="4430">And we nailed it down so
that it was 0 at 0.</p>
<p t="1094860" d="2680">Another way of interpreting
that, and let me show it to</p>
<p t="1097540" d="3020">you underneath, is
the following.</p>
<p t="1100560" d="3600">When we look at its derivative,
its derivative,</p>
<p t="1104160" d="4030">course, is the function e ^ x.</p>
<p t="1108190" d="1850">Sorry, e ^ - x ^2.</p>
<p t="1110040" d="7390">So that's this shape here.</p>
<p t="1117430" d="4240">And you can see the slope is 0,
but fairly close to 0, but</p>
<p t="1121670" d="940">positive along here.</p>
<p t="1122610" d="1950">It's getting, this is
its steepest point.</p>
<p t="1124560" d="1530">This is the highest
point here.</p>
<p t="1126090" d="2120">And then it's leveling off
again; the slope is going</p>
<p t="1128210" d="2460">down, always positive.</p>
<p t="1130670" d="6190">This is the graph of
F' = e ^ -x^2.</p>
<p t="1136860" d="5580">Now, the interpretation of the
function that's up above is</p>
<p t="1142440" d="6070">that the value here is
the area from 0 to x.</p>
<p t="1148510" d="4180">So this is area F(x).</p>
<p t="1152690" d="3880">Maybe I'll color it in, decorate
it a little bit.</p>
<p t="1156570" d="8550">So this area here is F ( x).</p>
<p t="1165120" d="3720">Now, I want to show you
this odd property,</p>
<p t="1168840" d="2060">by using this symmetry.</p>
<p t="1170900" d="4450">The graph here is even, so in
other words, what's back here</p>
<p t="1175350" d="3940">is exactly the same
as what's forward.</p>
<p t="1179290" d="3290">But now there's a reversal.</p>
<p t="1182580" d="2490">Because we're keeping track
of the area starting</p>
<p t="1185070" d="1260">from 0 going forward.</p>
<p t="1186330" d="760">That's positive.</p>
<p t="1187090" d="2850">If we go backwards, it's
counted negatively.</p>
<p t="1189940" d="2850">So if we went backwards to - x,
we'd get exactly the same</p>
<p t="1192790" d="2180">as that green patch
over there.</p>
<p t="1194970" d="1840">We'd get a red patch
over here.</p>
<p t="1196810" d="4470">But it would be counted
negatively.</p>
<p t="1201280" d="2930">And that's the property
that it's odd.</p>
<p t="1204210" d="1800">You can also check this
by properties</p>
<p t="1206010" d="2910">of integrals directly.</p>
<p t="1208920" d="7270">That would be just like
this process here.</p>
<p t="1216190" d="3720">So it's completely analogous
to checking this</p>
<p t="1219910" d="5500">formula over there.</p>
<p t="1225410" d="4260">So that's one of the comments
I wanted to make about this.</p>
<p t="1229670" d="2440">And why does this save us
a lot of time, if we</p>
<p t="1232110" d="990">know this is odd?</p>
<p t="1233100" d="3170">Well, we know that the shape of
this branch is exactly the</p>
<p t="1236270" d="2680">reverse, or the reflection,
if you like, of the</p>
<p t="1238950" d="990">shape of this one.</p>
<p t="1239940" d="2240">What we want to do is flip it
under the axis and then</p>
<p t="1242180" d="2780">reflect it over that way.</p>
<p t="1244960" d="8630">And that's the symmetry property
of the graph of F(x).</p>
<p t="1253590" d="4330">Now, the last property that I
want to mention is what's</p>
<p t="1257920" d="2830">happening with the ends.</p>
<p t="1260750" d="2820">And at the end there's
an asymptote,</p>
<p t="1263570" d="2250">there's a limit here.</p>
<p t="1265820" d="4880">So this is an asymptote.</p>
<p t="1270700" d="2140">And the same thing down here,
which will be exactly because</p>
<p t="1272840" d="2950">of the odd feature, this'll
be exactly negative.</p>
<p t="1275790" d="3780">The opposite value over here.</p>
<p t="1279570" d="4000">And you might ask yourself, what
level is this, exactly.</p>
<p t="1283570" d="3280">Now, that level turns out to be
a very important quantity.</p>
<p t="1286850" d="2910">It's interpreted down here as
the area under this whole</p>
<p t="1289760" d="1860">infinite stretch.</p>
<p t="1291620" d="5050">It's all the way out
to infinity.</p>
<p t="1296670" d="2290">So, let's see.</p>
<p t="1298960" d="9780">What do you think it is?</p>
<p t="1308740" d="1010">You're all clueless.</p>
<p t="1309750" d="2710">Well, maybe not all of you,
you're just afraid to say.</p>
<p t="1312460" d="1680">So it's obvious.</p>
<p t="1314140" d="2900">It's the square root of pi/2.</p>
<p t="1317040" d="3130">That was right on the tip of
your tongue, wasn't it?</p>
<p t="1320170" d="1440">STUDENT: Ah, yes.</p>
<p t="1321610" d="2640">PROFESSOR: Right, so this is
actually very un-obvious, but</p>
<p t="1324250" d="2040">it's a very important
quantity.</p>
<p t="1326290" d="2460">And it's an amazing fact
that this thing</p>
<p t="1328750" d="1970">approaches this number.</p>
<p t="1330720" d="7340">And it's something that people
worried about for many years</p>
<p t="1338060" d="4800">before actually nailing down.</p>
<p t="1342860" d="3845">And so what I just claimed here
is that the limit as x</p>
<p t="1346705" d="6595">approaches infinity of F ( x)
= the square root of pi / 2.</p>
<p t="1353300" d="2400">And similarly, if you do it to
minus infinity, you'll get</p>
<p t="1355700" d="2670">minus square root of pi/2.</p>
<p t="1358370" d="3720">And for this reason, people
introduce a new function</p>
<p t="1362090" d="1920">because they like
the number 1.</p>
<p t="1364010" d="5730">This function is erf, short
for error function.</p>
<p t="1369740" d="4400">And it's 2 / the square root of
pi times the integral from</p>
<p t="1374140" d="3490">0 to x, e ^ - t ^2 dt.</p>
<p t="1377630" d="2580">In other words, it's just our
original, our previous</p>
<p t="1380210" d="8030">function multiplied by 2 /
the square root of pi.</p>
<p t="1388240" d="2640">And that's the function which
gets tabulated quite a lot.</p>
<p t="1390880" d="3640">You'll see it on the internet
everywhere, and it's a very</p>
<p t="1394520" d="1380">important function.</p>
<p t="1395900" d="2640">There are other normalizations
that are used, and the</p>
<p t="1398540" d="2720">discussions of the other
normalizations are in your</p>
<p t="1401260" d="4020">problems. This is one
of them, and another</p>
<p t="1405280" d="2260">one is in your exercises.</p>
<p t="1407540" d="3590">The standard normal
distribution.</p>
<p t="1411130" d="2530">There are tons of functions
like this, which are new</p>
<p t="1413660" d="2260">functions that we can
get at once we</p>
<p t="1415920" d="1730">have the tool of integrals.</p>
<p t="1417650" d="2930">And I'll write down just one
or two more, just so that</p>
<p t="1420580" d="2180">you'll see the variety.</p>
<p t="1422760" d="6320">Here's one which is called
a Fresnel integral.</p>
<p t="1429080" d="3300">On your problem set next week,
we'll do the other Fresnel</p>
<p t="1432380" d="4710">integral, we'll look
at this one.</p>
<p t="1437090" d="4900">These functions cannot be
expressed in elementary terms.</p>
<p t="1441990" d="9900">The one on your homework for
this week was this one.</p>
<p t="1451890" d="3090">This one comes up in
Fourier analysis.</p>
<p t="1454980" d="4930">And I'm going to just tell you
maybe one more such function.</p>
<p t="1459910" d="3400">There's a function which is
called Li ( x), logarithmic</p>
<p t="1463310" d="6910">integral of x, which
is this guy.</p>
<p t="1470220" d="3420">The reciprocal of the logarithm,
the natural log.</p>
<p t="1473640" d="5160">And the significance of this
one is that Li ( x) is</p>
<p t="1478800" d="10880">approximately equal to the
number of primes &lt; x.</p>
<p t="1489680" d="4750">And, in fact, if you can make
this as precise as possible,</p>
<p t="1494430" d="4550">you'll be famous for millennia,
because this is</p>
<p t="1498980" d="2850">known as the Riemann
hypothesis.</p>
<p t="1501830" d="3540">Exactly how closely this
approximation occurs.</p>
<p t="1505370" d="4350">But it's a hard problem, and
already a century ago the</p>
<p t="1509720" d="2540">prime number theorem, which
established this connection</p>
<p t="1512260" d="6190">was extremely important
to progress in math.</p>
<p t="1518450" d="890">Yeah, question.</p>
<p t="1519340" d="2010">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p t="1521350" d="2350">PROFESSOR: Is this stuff you're
supposed to understand.</p>
<p t="1523700" d="1140">That's a good question.</p>
<p t="1524840" d="1460">I love that question.</p>
<p t="1526300" d="4700">The answer is, this is,
so we launched off</p>
<p t="1531000" d="1080">into something here.</p>
<p t="1532080" d="2230">And let me just explain
it to you.</p>
<p t="1534310" d="2830">I'm going to be talking a fair
amount more about this</p>
<p t="1537140" d="5000">particular function, because
it's associated to the normal</p>
<p t="1542140" d="1100">distribution.</p>
<p t="1543240" d="2000">And I'm going to let you
get familiar with it.</p>
<p t="1545240" d="2570">What I'm doing here is
purely cultural.</p>
<p t="1547810" d="3690">Well, after this panel, what I'm
doing is purely cultural.</p>
<p t="1551500" d="2560">Just saying there's a lot
of other beasts out</p>
<p t="1554060" d="1750">there in the world.</p>
<p t="1555810" d="2120">And one of them is called
C of [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p t="1557930" d="3530">So we'll have a just a very
passing familiarity with one</p>
<p t="1561460" d="1460">or two of these functions.</p>
<p t="1562920" d="2830">But there are literally dozens
and dozens of them.</p>
<p t="1565750" d="3230">The only thing that you'll need
to do with such functions</p>
<p t="1568980" d="4250">is things like understanding
the derivative, the second</p>
<p t="1573230" d="2910">derivative, and tracking
what the function does.</p>
<p t="1576140" d="2810">Sketching the same way you
did with any other tool.</p>
<p t="1578950" d="3920">So we're going to do this type
of thing with these functions.</p>
<p t="1582870" d="2890">And I'll have to lead
you through.</p>
<p t="1585760" d="1930">If I wanted to ask you a
question about one of these</p>
<p t="1587690" d="4780">functions, I have to tell you
exactly what I'm aiming for.</p>
<p t="1592470" d="3490">Yeah, another question.</p>
<p t="1595960" d="620">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p t="1596580" d="182">PROFESSOR: Yeah, I did.</p>
<p t="1596762" d="6758">I called these guys
Fresnel integrals.</p>
<p t="1603520" d="3940">The guy's name is Fresnel.</p>
<p t="1607460" d="1720">It's just named after
a person.</p>
<p t="1609180" d="3270">But, and this one, Li's
logarithmic integral, it's not</p>
<p t="1612450" d="800">named after a person.</p>
<p t="1613250" d="3570">Logarithm is not somebody's
name.</p>
<p t="1616820" d="5140">So look, in fact this will be
mentioned also on a problem</p>
<p t="1621960" d="2490">set, but I don't expect you
to remember these names.</p>
<p t="1624450" d="2520">In particular, that you
definitely don't want to try</p>
<p t="1626970" d="630">to remember.</p>
<p t="1627600" d="1130">Yes, another question.</p>
<p t="1628730" d="1290">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p t="1630020" d="5220">PROFESSOR: The question is,
will we prove this limit.</p>
<p t="1635240" d="2230">And the answer is yes,
if we have time.</p>
<p t="1637470" d="4020">It'll be in about
a week or so.</p>
<p t="1641490" d="1200">We're not going to do it now.</p>
<p t="1642690" d="6320">It takes us quite a bit
of work to do it.</p>
<p t="1649010" d="3620">OK.</p>
<p t="1652630" d="3630">I'm going to change years now,
I'm going to shift gears.</p>
<p t="1656260" d="5490">And we're going to go back to
a more standard thing which</p>
<p t="1661750" d="2900">has to do with just setting
up integrals.</p>
<p t="1664650" d="3170">And this has to do with
understanding where integrals</p>
<p t="1667820" d="3090">play a role, and they play a
role in cumulative sums, in</p>
<p t="1670910" d="1250">evaluating things.</p>
<p t="1672160" d="3320">This is much more closely
associated with the first</p>
<p t="1675480" d="1540">Fundamental Theorem.</p>
<p t="1677020" d="2900">That is, we'll take, today
we were talking about how</p>
<p t="1679920" d="2340">integrals are formulas
for functions.</p>
<p t="1682260" d="2470">Or solutions to differential
equations.</p>
<p t="1684730" d="4180">We're going to go back and talk
about integrals as being</p>
<p t="1688910" d="5050">the answer to a question
as opposed to.</p>
<p t="1693960" d="440">what we've done now.</p>
<p t="1694400" d="4600">So in other words, and the first
example, or most of the</p>
<p t="1699000" d="3880">examples for now, are going
to be taken from geometry.</p>
<p t="1702880" d="4560">Later on we'll get
to probability.</p>
<p t="1707440" d="17110">And the first topic is just
areas between curves.</p>
<p t="1724550" d="2340">Here's the idea.</p>
<p t="1726890" d="3420">If you have a couple of curves
that look like this and maybe</p>
<p t="1730310" d="4020">like this, and you want to start
at a place a and you</p>
<p t="1734330" d="9150">want to end at a place b, then
you can chop it up the same</p>
<p t="1743480" d="4290">way we did with Riemann
sums. And take a chunk</p>
<p t="1747770" d="3010">that looks like this.</p>
<p t="1750780" d="2030">And I'm going to write the
thickness of that chunk.</p>
<p t="1752810" d="1900">Well, let's give these
things names.</p>
<p t="1754710" d="2780">Let's say the top curve is
f(x), and the bottom</p>
<p t="1757490" d="3020">curve is g ( x).</p>
<p t="1760510" d="6470">And then this thickness
is going to be dx.</p>
<p t="1766980" d="3040">That's the thickness.</p>
<p t="1770020" d="2280">And what is the height?</p>
<p t="1772300" d="2580">Well, the height is the
difference between the top</p>
<p t="1774880" d="4090">value and the bottom value.</p>
<p t="1778970" d="5150">So here we have (f (
x) - g ( x)) dx.</p>
<p t="1784120" d="6000">This is, if you like, base times
- whoops, backwards.</p>
<p t="1790120" d="4730">This is height, and this is
the base of the rectangle.</p>
<p t="1794850" d="2000">And these are approximately
correct.</p>
<p t="1796850" d="2840">But of course, only in limit
when this is an infinitesimal,</p>
<p t="1799690" d="4200">is it exactly right.</p>
<p t="1803890" d="2330">In order to get the
whole area, I have</p>
<p t="1806220" d="4160">add these guys up.</p>
<p t="1810380" d="1540">So I'm going to integrate
from a to b.</p>
<p t="1811920" d="2430">That's summing them, that's
adding them up.</p>
<p t="1814350" d="2120">And that's going
to be my area.</p>
<p t="1816470" d="10810">So that's the story here.</p>
<p t="1827280" d="2740">Now, let me just say two
things about this.</p>
<p t="1830020" d="3340">First of all, on a very abstract
level before we get</p>
<p t="1833360" d="3150">started with details of more
complicated problems. The</p>
<p t="1836510" d="3830">first one is that every problem
that I'm going to be</p>
<p t="1840340" d="3770">talking about from now on for,
several days, involves the</p>
<p t="1844110" d="4590">following collection of,
the following goals.</p>
<p t="1848700" d="3390">I want to identify something
to integrate.</p>
<p t="1852090" d="5920">That's called an integrand.</p>
<p t="1858010" d="8410">And I want to identify what
are known as the limits.</p>
<p t="1866420" d="5680">The whole game is simply to
figure out what a, b, and this</p>
<p t="1872100" d="1140">quantity is here.</p>
<p t="1873240" d="2240">Whatever it is.</p>
<p t="1875480" d="2610">And the minute we have that, we
can calculate the integral</p>
<p t="1878090" d="1720">if we like.</p>
<p t="1879810" d="2620">We have numerical procedures
or maybe we have analytic</p>
<p t="1882430" d="2720">procedures, but anyway we
can get at the integral.</p>
<p t="1885150" d="2430">The goal here is
to set them up.</p>
<p t="1887580" d="2000">And in order to set
them up, you must</p>
<p t="1889580" d="2140">know these three things.</p>
<p t="1891720" d="2300">The lower limit, the upper
limit, and what we're</p>
<p t="1894020" d="3900">integrating.</p>
<p t="1897920" d="4360">If you leave one of these out,
it's like the following thing.</p>
<p t="1902280" d="3170">I ask you what the area
of this region is.</p>
<p t="1905450" d="3290">If I left out this end, how
could I possibly know?</p>
<p t="1908740" d="2430">I don't even know where it
starts, so how can I figure</p>
<p t="1911170" d="2070">out what this area is if I
haven't identified what the</p>
<p t="1913240" d="1990">left side is.</p>
<p t="1915230" d="2980">I can't leave out the bottom.</p>
<p t="1918210" d="2350">It's sitting here,
in this formula.</p>
<p t="1920560" d="2890">Because I need to know
where it is.</p>
<p t="1923450" d="1890">And I need to know the top and
I need to know this side.</p>
<p t="1925340" d="2260">Those are the four sides
of the figure.</p>
<p t="1927600" d="2760">If I don't incorporate them
into the information, I'll</p>
<p t="1930360" d="1280">never get anything out.</p>
<p t="1931640" d="1980">So I need to know everything.</p>
<p t="1933620" d="2420">And I need to know exactly those
things, in order to have</p>
<p t="1936040" d="4700">a formula for the area.</p>
<p t="1940740" d="3670">Now, when this gets carried out
in practice, as we will do</p>
<p t="1944410" d="4020">now in our first example,
it's more</p>
<p t="1948430" d="1220">complicated than it looks.</p>
<p t="1949650" d="19030">So here's our first example:
Find the area between x = y ^2</p>
<p t="1968680" d="8970">and y = x - 2.</p>
<p t="1977650" d="2460">This is our first example.</p>
<p t="1980110" d="4840">Let me make sure that I chose
the example that I wanted to.</p>
<p t="1984950" d="3470">Yeah.</p>
<p t="1988420" d="11880">Now, there's a first step in
figuring these things out.</p>
<p t="2000300" d="7360">And this is that you must
draw a picture.</p>
<p t="2007660" d="2630">If you don't draw a picture
you'll never figure out what</p>
<p t="2010290" d="3390">this area is, because you'll
never figure out what's what</p>
<p t="2013680" d="2610">between these curves.</p>
<p t="2016290" d="4250">The first curve, y = x
^2, is a parabola.</p>
<p t="2020540" d="2450">But x is a function of y.</p>
<p t="2022990" d="2100">It's pointing this way.</p>
<p t="2025090" d="2360">So it's this parabola here.</p>
<p t="2027450" d="3240">That's y = x^2.</p>
<p t="2030690" d="7220">Whoops, x = y ^2.</p>
<p t="2037910" d="8790">The second curve is a line, a
straight line of slope 1,</p>
<p t="2046700" d="2970">starting at (x = 2, y = 0).</p>
<p t="2049670" d="4490">It goes through this place here,
which is 2 over and has</p>
<p t="2054160" d="5900">slope 1, so it does this.</p>
<p t="2060060" d="3450">And this shape in here is what
we mean by the area between</p>
<p t="2063510" d="590">the curves.</p>
<p t="2064100" d="3040">Now that we see what it is,
we have a better idea of</p>
<p t="2067140" d="990">what our goal is.</p>
<p t="2068130" d="11180">If you haven't drawn it,
you have no hope.</p>
<p t="2079310" d="3810">Now, I'm going to describe
two ways of getting</p>
<p t="2083120" d="7540">at this area here.</p>
<p t="2090660" d="10000">And the first one is motivated
by the shape that I just</p>
<p t="2100660" d="2310">described right here.</p>
<p t="2102970" d="4240">Namely, I'm going to use it
in a straightforward way.</p>
<p t="2107210" d="5350">I'm going to chop things up
into these vertical pieces</p>
<p t="2112560" d="4600">just as I did right there.</p>
<p t="2117160" d="2255">Now, here's the difficulty
with that.</p>
<p t="2119415" d="6885">The difficulty is that the
upper curve here has one</p>
<p t="2126300" d="3140">formula but the lower curve
shifts from being a part of</p>
<p t="2129440" d="3680">the parabola to being a part
of the straight line.</p>
<p t="2133120" d="2340">That means that there are two
different formulas for the</p>
<p t="2135460" d="1470">lower function.</p>
<p t="2136930" d="3010">And the only way to accommodate
that is to</p>
<p t="2139940" d="2840">separate this up into
two halves.</p>
<p t="2142780" d="2200">Separate it out into
two halves.</p>
<p t="2144980" d="5340">I'm going to have to divide
it right here.</p>
<p t="2150320" d="4000">So we must break it into two
pieces and find the integral</p>
<p t="2154320" d="3030">of one half and the other half.</p>
<p t="2157350" d="430">Question?</p>
<p t="2157780" d="9680">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p t="2167460" d="600">PROFESSOR: So, you're one
step ahead of me.</p>
<p t="2168060" d="2060">We'll also have to be sure to
distinguish between the top</p>
<p t="2170120" d="2410">branch and the bottom branch of
the parabola, which we're</p>
<p t="2172530" d="1900">about to do.</p>
<p t="2174430" d="3900">Now, in order to distinguish
what's going on I actually</p>
<p t="2178330" d="3670">have to use multi colors here.</p>
<p t="2182000" d="2680">And so we will do that.</p>
<p t="2184680" d="5040">First there's the top part,
which is orange.</p>
<p t="2189720" d="2480">That's the top part.</p>
<p t="2192200" d="1790">I'll call it top.</p>
<p t="2193990" d="7610">And then there's the bottom
part, which has two halves.</p>
<p t="2201600" d="11680">They are pink, and I
guess this is blue.</p>
<p t="2213280" d="7960">Alright, so now let's see
what's happening.</p>
<p t="2221240" d="6000">The most important two points
that I have to figure out in</p>
<p t="2227240" d="1340">order to get started here.</p>
<p t="2228580" d="1380">Well, really I'm going
to have to figure out</p>
<p t="2229960" d="1050">three points, I claim.</p>
<p t="2231010" d="2450">I'm going to have to figure
out where this point is.</p>
<p t="2233460" d="4190">Where this point is, and
where that point is.</p>
<p t="2237650" d="3100">If I know where these three
points are, then I have a</p>
<p t="2240750" d="2570">chance of knowing where
to start, where</p>
<p t="2243320" d="2070">to end, and so forth.</p>
<p t="2245390" d="780">Another question.</p>
<p t="2246170" d="1320">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p t="2247490" d="3620">PROFESSOR: Could you speak up?</p>
<p t="2251110" d="6660">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p t="2257770" d="1580">PROFESSOR: The question
is, why do we need to</p>
<p t="2259350" d="2100">split up the area.</p>
<p t="2261450" d="2880">And I think in order to answer
that question further, I'm</p>
<p t="2264330" d="2720">going to have to go into the
details of the method, and</p>
<p t="2267050" d="4430">then you'll see where
it's necessary.</p>
<p t="2271480" d="3390">So the first step is that I'm
going to figure out what these</p>
<p t="2274870" d="2290">three points are.</p>
<p t="2277160" d="5300">This one is kind of easy;
it's the point (0, 0).</p>
<p t="2282460" d="2610">This point down here and
this point up here are</p>
<p t="2285070" d="2940">intersections of
the two curves.</p>
<p t="2288010" d="3140">I can identify them by the
following equation.</p>
<p t="2291150" d="10180">I need to see where these
curves intersect.</p>
<p t="2301330" d="5360">At what, well, if I plug in x
= y^2, I get y = y^2 - 2.</p>
<p t="2306690" d="2320">And then I can solve this
quadratic equation. y</p>
<p t="2309010" d="4830">^2 - y - 2 = 0.</p>
<p t="2313840" d="5520">So (y - 2)( y + 1) = 0.</p>
<p t="2319360" d="13270">And this is telling me that
y = 2 or y = - 1.</p>
<p t="2332630" d="1620">So I've found y = - 1.</p>
<p t="2334250" d="6180">That means this point down here
has second entry - 1.</p>
<p t="2340430" d="4340">Its first entry, its x value,
I can get from this formula</p>
<p t="2344770" d="2120">here or the other formula.</p>
<p t="2346890" d="3910">I have to square,
this - 1 ^2 = 1.</p>
<p t="2350800" d="4220">So that's the formula
for this point.</p>
<p t="2355020" d="5160">And the other point has
second entry 2.</p>
<p t="2360180" d="3510">And, again, with his formula y
= x ^2, I have to square y to</p>
<p t="2363690" d="8100">get x, so this is 4.</p>
<p t="2371790" d="5550">Now, I claim I have enough
data to get started.</p>
<p t="2377340" d="3820">But maybe I'll identify
one more thing.</p>
<p t="2381160" d="7730">I need the top, the bottom left,
and the bottom right.</p>
<p t="2388890" d="6040">The top is the formula for this
branch of x = y ^2, which</p>
<p t="2394930" d="2950">is in the positive y region.</p>
<p t="2397880" d="7250">And that is y = the
square root of x.</p>
<p t="2405130" d="4800">The bottom curve, part of the
parabola, so this is the</p>
<p t="2409930" d="12050">bottom left, is y = minus
square root x.</p>
<p t="2421980" d="2230">That's the other branch
of the square root.</p>
<p t="2424210" d="2750">And this is exactly what
you were asking before.</p>
<p t="2426960" d="1850">And this is, we have to
distinguish between these two.</p>
<p t="2428810" d="2700">And the point is, these formulas
really are different.</p>
<p t="2431510" d="2890">They're not the same.</p>
<p t="2434400" d="3630">Now, the last bit is the bottom
right chunk here, which</p>
<p t="2438030" d="1880">is this pink part.</p>
<p t="2439910" d="4420">Bottom right.</p>
<p t="2444330" d="4730">And that one is the formula
for the line.</p>
<p t="2449060" d="6930">And that's y = x - 2.</p>
<p t="2455990" d="7460">Now I'm ready to
find the area.</p>
<p t="2463450" d="2620">It's going to be
in two chunks.</p>
<p t="2466070" d="8990">This is the left part,
plus the right part.</p>
<p t="2475060" d="3240">And the left part, and I want to
set it up as an integral, I</p>
<p t="2478300" d="3050">want there to be a dx and here
I want to set up an integral</p>
<p t="2481350" d="2390">and I want it to be dx.</p>
<p t="2483740" d="2660">I need to figure out what
the range of x is.</p>
<p t="2486400" d="1880">So, first I'm going to - well,
let's leave ourselves a little</p>
<p t="2488280" d="9360">more room than that.</p>
<p t="2497640" d="1670">Just to be safe.</p>
<p t="2499310" d="6430">OK, here's the right.</p>
<p t="2505740" d="2750">So here we have our dx.</p>
<p t="2508490" d="4670">Now, I need to figure out
the starting place</p>
<p t="2513160" d="1800">and the ending place.</p>
<p t="2514960" d="2465">So the starting place is
the leftmost place.</p>
<p t="2517425" d="2575">The leftmost place
is over here.</p>
<p t="2520000" d="2890">And x = 0 there.</p>
<p t="2522890" d="3270">So we're going to travel from
this vertical line to the</p>
<p t="2526160" d="2260">green line.</p>
<p t="2528420" d="650">Over here.</p>
<p t="2529070" d="4030">And that's from 0 to 1.</p>
<p t="2533100" d="4180">And the difference between the
orange curve and the blue</p>
<p t="2537280" d="5050">curve is what I call top and
bottom left, over there.</p>
<p t="2542330" d="9950">So that is square root of x
minus minus square root of x.</p>
<p t="2552280" d="8890">Again, this is what I call
top, and this was bottom.</p>
<p t="2561170" d="7680">But only the left.</p>
<p t="2568850" d="3720">I claim that's giving me the
left half of this, the left</p>
<p t="2572570" d="3080">section of this diagram.</p>
<p t="2575650" d="4130">Now I'm going to do the right
section of the diagram.</p>
<p t="2579780" d="2260">I start at 1.</p>
<p t="2582040" d="2120">The lower limit is 1.</p>
<p t="2584160" d="4330">And I go all the way
to this point here.</p>
<p t="2588490" d="2670">Which is the last bit.</p>
<p t="2591160" d="1910">And that's going to be x = 4.</p>
<p t="2593070" d="6060">The upper limit here is 4.</p>
<p t="2599130" d="2350">And now I have to take the
difference between the top and</p>
<p t="2601480" d="1090">the bottom again.</p>
<p t="2602570" d="2230">The top is square root
of x all over again.</p>
<p t="2604800" d="1770">But the bottom has changed.</p>
<p t="2606570" d="4860">The bottom is now the
quantity (x - 2).</p>
<p t="2611430" d="1560">Please don't forget
your parenthesis.</p>
<p t="2612990" d="11010">There's going to be minus
signs and cancellations.</p>
<p t="2624000" d="2420">Now, this is almost the
end of the problem.</p>
<p t="2626420" d="1850">The rest of it is routine.</p>
<p t="2628270" d="4170">We would just have to evaluate
these integrals.</p>
<p t="2632440" d="5060">And, fortunately, I'm going
to spare you that.</p>
<p t="2637500" d="1830">We're not going to
bother to do it.</p>
<p t="2639330" d="1720">That's the easy part.</p>
<p t="2641050" d="2520">We're not going to do it.</p>
<p t="2643570" d="2270">But I'm going to show you that
there's a much quicker way</p>
<p t="2645840" d="1480">with this integral.</p>
<p t="2647320" d="2660">And with this area calculation.</p>
<p t="2649980" d="930">Right now.</p>
<p t="2650910" d="4970">The quicker way is what
you see when you see</p>
<p t="2655880" d="2150">how long this is.</p>
<p t="2658030" d="2650">And you see that there's another
device that you can</p>
<p t="2660680" d="3670">use that looks similar in
principle to this, but</p>
<p t="2664350" d="3900">reverses the roles of x and y.</p>
<p t="2668250" d="5300">And the other device, which
I'll draw over here,</p>
<p t="2673550" d="1980">schematically.</p>
<p t="2675530" d="11600">No, maybe I'll draw it on
this blackboard here.</p>
<p t="2687130" d="8690">So, Method 2, if you like,
this was Method 1, and we</p>
<p t="2695820" d="8360">should call it the hard way.</p>
<p t="2704180" d="8680">Method 2, which is better
in this case, is to use</p>
<p t="2712860" d="11850">horizontal slices.</p>
<p t="2724710" d="8390">Let me draw the picture,
at least schematically.</p>
<p t="2733100" d="2130">Here's our picture that
we had before.</p>
<p t="2735230" d="3910">And now instead of slicing it
vertically, I'm going to slice</p>
<p t="2739140" d="1390">it horizontally.</p>
<p t="2740530" d="4380">Like this.</p>
<p t="2744910" d="4830">Now, the dimensions have
different names.</p>
<p t="2749740" d="2250">But the principle is similar.</p>
<p t="2751990" d="3180">The width, we now call dy.</p>
<p t="2755170" d="3430">Because it's the change in y.</p>
<p t="2758600" d="7100">And this distance here, from the
left end to the right end,</p>
<p t="2765700" d="4250">we have to figure out what the
formulas for those things are.</p>
<p t="2769950" d="6550">So on the left, maybe I'll draw
them color coded again.</p>
<p t="2776500" d="3130">So here's a left.</p>
<p t="2779630" d="3770">And, whoops, orange
is right, I guess.</p>
<p t="2783400" d="1180">So here we go.</p>
<p t="2784580" d="5890">So we have the left, which
is this green.</p>
<p t="2790470" d="4960">Is x = y ^2.</p>
<p t="2795430" d="10660">And the right, which is
orange, is y = x - 2.</p>
<p t="2806090" d="4770">And now in order to use this,
it's going to turn out that we</p>
<p t="2810860" d="2310">want to write x as, we want
to reverse roles.</p>
<p t="2813170" d="4650">So we want to write this as
x is a function of y.</p>
<p t="2817820" d="6740">So we'll use it in this form.</p>
<p t="2824560" d="7390">And now I want to set up
the integral for you.</p>
<p t="2831950" d="2750">This time, the area
is equal to an</p>
<p t="2834700" d="6500">integral in the dy variable.</p>
<p t="2841200" d="5150">And its starting place
is down here.</p>
<p t="2846350" d="2610">And it's ending place
is up there.</p>
<p t="2848960" d="1890">This is the lowest value
of y, and this is the</p>
<p t="2850850" d="1050">top value of y.</p>
<p t="2851900" d="3040">And we've already computed
those things.</p>
<p t="2854940" d="4890">The lowest level of y is - 1.</p>
<p t="2859830" d="2370">So this is y = - 1.</p>
<p t="2862200" d="3460">And this top value is y = 2.</p>
<p t="2865660" d="5830">So this goes from - 1 to 2.</p>
<p t="2871490" d="5710">And now the difference is this
distance here, the distance</p>
<p t="2877200" d="2680">between the rightmost point
and the leftmost point.</p>
<p t="2879880" d="2140">Those are the two dimensions.</p>
<p t="2882020" d="2890">So again, it's a rectangle but
its horizontal is long and its</p>
<p t="2884910" d="2720">vertical is very short.</p>
<p t="2887630" d="690">And what are they?</p>
<p t="2888320" d="3210">It's the difference between
the right and the left.</p>
<p t="2891530" d="10230">The right-hand is (y + 2), and
the right-hand is y ^2.</p>
<p t="2901760" d="5230">So this is the formula.</p>
<p t="2906990" d="8760">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p t="2915750" d="3340">PROFESSOR: What was
the question?</p>
<p t="2919090" d="2540">Why is it right minus left?</p>
<p t="2921630" d="1140">That's very important.</p>
<p t="2922770" d="1770">Why is it right minus left?</p>
<p t="2924540" d="2690">And that's actually the point
that I was about to make.</p>
<p t="2927230" d="1170">Which is this.</p>
<p t="2928400" d="5460">That y + 2, which is the right,
is bigger than y ^2,</p>
<p t="2933860" d="1620">which is the left.</p>
<p t="2935480" d="4840">So that means that y +
2 - y ^2 is positive.</p>
<p t="2940320" d="2510">If you do it backwards, you'll
always get a negative number</p>
<p t="2942830" d="4470">and you'll always get
the wrong answer.</p>
<p t="2947300" d="3710">So this is the right-hand end
minus the left-hand end gives</p>
<p t="2951010" d="3290">you a positive number.</p>
<p t="2954300" d="2460">And it's not obvious, actually,
where you are.</p>
<p t="2956760" d="2270">There's another double-check,
by the way.</p>
<p t="2959030" d="2000">When you look at this quantity,
you see that the</p>
<p t="2961030" d="1600">ends pinch.</p>
<p t="2962630" d="2690">And that's exactly the
crossover points.</p>
<p t="2965320" d="5630">That is, when y = - 1,
y + 2 - y ^2 = 0.</p>
<p t="2970950" d="5990">And when y = 2, y
+ 2 - y ^2 = 0.</p>
<p t="2976940" d="3300">And that's not an accident,
that's exactly the geometry of</p>
<p t="2980240" d="4360">the shape that we picked
out there.</p>
<p t="2984600" d="1960">So this is the technique.</p>
<p t="2986560" d="4640">Now, this is a much more
routine integral.</p>
<p t="2991200" d="2880">I'm not going to carry it out,
I'll just do one last step.</p>
<p t="2994080" d="7320">Which is that this is (y ^2
/ 2) + 2y - (y ^3 / 3),</p>
<p t="3001400" d="2200">evaluated at - 1 and 2.</p>
<p t="3003600" d="4710">Which, if you work
it out, is 9/2.</p>
<p t="3008310" d="1920">So we're done for today.</p>
<p t="3010230" d="3410">And tomorrow we'll do more
volumes, more things including</p>
<p t="3013640" d="1430">three dimensions.</p>
