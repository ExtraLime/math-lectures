<p t="24780" d="1717">PROFESSOR: OK,
let's get started.</p>
<p t="29400" d="3120">Last week we talked
about random variables.</p>
<p t="32520" d="2020">And this week
we're going to talk</p>
<p t="34540" d="3010">about their expected value.</p>
<p t="37550" d="3450">The expected value
of a random variable</p>
<p t="41000" d="1637">comes up in all sorts
of applications.</p>
<p t="42637" d="2083">We're going to spend a
whole week talking about it</p>
<p t="44720" d="2260">and some of next week
talking about variations</p>
<p t="46980" d="1516">from the expected value.</p>
<p t="48496" d="1374">And it's probably
one of the best</p>
<p t="49870" d="2320">tools you have for
working with probability</p>
<p t="52190" d="2099">problems in practice.</p>
<p t="54289" d="1458">So let's write down
the definition.</p>
<p t="64129" d="8191">The expected value
also has other names.</p>
<p t="72320" d="11250">It's also known as the
average or the mean</p>
<p t="83570" d="1113">of a random variable.</p>
<p t="89390" d="12560">Random variable R over
a probability space S</p>
<p t="101950" d="2570">is denoted by a lot of ways.</p>
<p t="104520" d="4240">We're going to use Ex
to denote it, Ex of R.</p>
<p t="108760" d="3310">And it's the sum over all
possible outcomes in the sample</p>
<p t="112070" d="3600">space of the value of
the random variable</p>
<p t="115670" d="5520">on that outcome times the
probability of that outcome.</p>
<p t="121190" d="3120">In other words, the expected
value of a random variable</p>
<p t="124310" d="4770">is just a weighted average
of all possible values</p>
<p t="129080" d="4300">of the random variable where
the weight is the probability</p>
<p t="133380" d="2530">of that happening.</p>
<p t="135910" d="11528">For example, suppose we
roll a fair six sided die.</p>
<p t="150860" d="2950">So the numbers that
come up are 1 to 6.</p>
<p t="153810" d="4080">And we let R be the
random variable denoting</p>
<p t="157890" d="2245">the outcome, 1 through 6.</p>
<p t="163330" d="2660">So the expected
value of the role,</p>
<p t="165990" d="4170">we can easily compute
from the definition.</p>
<p t="170160" d="4730">Well, there's a 1/6 chance
that it comes out a 1.</p>
<p t="174890" d="1310">The next outcome would be a 2.</p>
<p t="176200" d="3400">That happens with 1/6 chance.</p>
<p t="179600" d="3425">3, 4, 5, and six all
happen with a 1/6 chance.</p>
<p t="186680" d="6320">If I sum up 1, 2, 3, 4 up to
6, I get 6 times 7 over 2 times</p>
<p t="193000" d="3910">the 1/6 is just 7
over 2 or 3 and 1/2.</p>
<p t="199590" d="3730">So expected value when I roll
a die, a fair six sided die,</p>
<p t="203320" d="2000">is just 3 and 1/2.</p>
<p t="205320" d="2560">And as you can see
from this example,</p>
<p t="207880" d="3330">the expected value doesn't
have to be attainable by one</p>
<p t="211210" d="1820">of the outcomes.</p>
<p t="213030" d="3700">You don't get a 3 and
1/2 when you roll a die.</p>
<p t="216730" d="3110">But that's the average value.</p>
<p t="219840" d="4240">Now the expected value, the
expectation, the average,</p>
<p t="224080" d="2732">the mean, they're
all the same thing.</p>
<p t="226812" d="1958">They're all defined based
on a random variable.</p>
<p t="228770" d="2120">They all mean the same thing.</p>
<p t="230890" d="3494">They are all different
than the median.</p>
<p t="234384" d="1416">That's something
that's different.</p>
<p t="235800" d="2600">So let me define the median.</p>
<p t="238400" d="3690">Basically it is the
outcome which splits</p>
<p t="242090" d="1300">the probabilities in half.</p>
<p t="243390" d="1640">In other words, you've
got a 50% chance</p>
<p t="245030" d="3230">of being bigger than the median
and a 50% chance of being</p>
<p t="248260" d="1500">smaller.</p>
<p t="249760" d="7449">Now precisely you can
define it this way.</p>
<p t="257209" d="7741">The median of a
random variable R</p>
<p t="264950" d="10350">is the value in the range of
R such that the probability</p>
<p t="275300" d="4400">that the random variable is
less than this median point is</p>
<p t="279700" d="2320">at most 1/2.</p>
<p t="282020" d="2310">And the probability
that random variable</p>
<p t="284330" d="3756">is bigger than the median
is strictly less than 1/2.</p>
<p t="290910" d="2040">Now, some texts
do it differently.</p>
<p t="292950" d="3994">They swap this less than
or equal to with this one.</p>
<p t="296944" d="1666">And it could give you
a different answer</p>
<p t="298610" d="2560">if you do that.</p>
<p t="301170" d="3336">And I think in the text,
actually, we screwed it up.</p>
<p t="304506" d="1374">So we have to get
that corrected.</p>
<p t="305880" d="1916">I think we might have
put a less than or equal</p>
<p t="307796" d="2194">here, which is not
the right definition.</p>
<p t="309990" d="3170">So this is the right
definition that we'll use.</p>
<p t="313160" d="3570">So using this definition,
what is the median</p>
<p t="316730" d="4220">of the random variable that
corresponds to rolling a die?</p>
<p t="320950" d="3601">What's the median when I
roll a six sided fair die?</p>
<p t="327810" d="5010">Not 3 and 1/2, because it's
got to be one of the values.</p>
<p t="332820" d="2832">The median does have
to be in the realm</p>
<p t="335652" d="958">of the random variable.</p>
<p t="336610" d="2730">It has to one of the
attainable values.</p>
<p t="339340" d="2560">What's the median value
when I roll a die?</p>
<p t="341900" d="1380">AUDIENCE: Four.</p>
<p t="343280" d="700">PROFESSOR: Four.</p>
<p t="343980" d="1600">Let's try that out.</p>
<p t="345580" d="4040">If I plug in 4 here, the
probability I'm less than 4</p>
<p t="349620" d="1170">is 1/2.</p>
<p t="350790" d="1750">Could be 1, 2, or 3.</p>
<p t="352540" d="4790">The probability of greater
than 4 is 5 or six is 1/3.</p>
<p t="357330" d="1140">That's less than 1/2.</p>
<p t="358470" d="1810">So 4 works.</p>
<p t="360280" d="5010">3 doesn't work, because the
probability I'm bigger than 3</p>
<p t="365290" d="1420">is 1/2.</p>
<p t="366710" d="1586">So it doesn't work.</p>
<p t="368296" d="1874">And the other definition
sometimes people use</p>
<p t="370170" d="1790">would turn out that
three is the median.</p>
<p t="374560" d="1600">Now, we're not going
to spend any more</p>
<p t="376160" d="2170">time talking about the median.</p>
<p t="378330" d="3100">What's really important in
probability is the mean.</p>
<p t="381430" d="1740">And that's because
you can do a whole lot</p>
<p t="383170" d="2800">more with it in applications.</p>
<p t="385970" d="5800">Any question about the
definitions so far?</p>
<p t="391770" d="5120">All right, so now we're going to
do a more interesting example.</p>
<p t="396890" d="2890">We're going to play
a gambling game</p>
<p t="399780" d="3330">and we're going to analyze the
expected winnings, the expected</p>
<p t="403110" d="1700">return.</p>
<p t="404810" d="2280">And this is a simple
three person game</p>
<p t="407090" d="5390">that you can see played
in bars and informally.</p>
<p t="412480" d="3110">But to play it I
need a volunteer</p>
<p t="415590" d="2035">from the class, somebody
who wants to play.</p>
<p t="417625" d="625">You've done it.</p>
<p t="418250" d="791">Who hasn't done it?</p>
<p t="419041" d="1318">Have you done it?</p>
<p t="420359" d="791">You haven't played.</p>
<p t="421150" d="1862">Do you have money
in your pocket?</p>
<p t="423012" d="1208">You got to borrow some money.</p>
<p t="424220" d="2828">If you don't have any money,
you got to borrow some.</p>
<p t="427048" d="1722">AUDIENCE: How much money?</p>
<p t="428770" d="2790">PROFESSOR: Oh, I
don't know, $5 or $10.</p>
<p t="431560" d="560">Got it?</p>
<p t="432120" d="1387">All right, come on down.</p>
<p t="435746" d="1874">you're going to play
against a couple of TAs.</p>
<p t="437620" d="3290">Maybe a couple of you
will want to play.</p>
<p t="440910" d="2720">I'll get Nick and
Martyna to play here.</p>
<p t="443630" d="4330">Now, this is a very simple game.</p>
<p t="447960" d="5100">In each round, each of the
players is going to wager $2.</p>
<p t="453060" d="3890">So I can loan you guys
some money here, I guess.</p>
<p t="456950" d="2791">So you have $2?</p>
<p t="459741" d="1499">All right, I have
to loan you money.</p>
<p t="461240" d="1406">I better count this out.</p>
<p t="462646" d="1708">AUDIENCE: I think I
can find the Zimbabwe</p>
<p t="464354" d="1546">dollars I had here somewhere.</p>
<p t="465900" d="1360">PROFESSOR: I don't know
if I'm taking those.</p>
<p t="467260" d="1166">Here, you can split that up.</p>
<p t="468426" d="1424">I loaned you guys $10 there.</p>
<p t="469850" d="1030">You got $2.</p>
<p t="470880" d="2900">Put it on the table.</p>
<p t="473780" d="1980">Wager your $2.</p>
<p t="475760" d="2400">Now what we're going
to do is they're each</p>
<p t="478160" d="4070">going to guess the
results of a coin toss.</p>
<p t="482230" d="3141">We'll put the pot
together here, mix it up.</p>
<p t="485371" d="999">You only have to do two.</p>
<p t="486370" d="1880">You can save those for now.</p>
<p t="488250" d="1170">Oh, that's your two.</p>
<p t="489420" d="2800">All right, so we
have $6 in the pot.</p>
<p t="492220" d="3450">Now, each of you is going to
guess the outcome of a coin.</p>
<p t="495670" d="1660">So here's the guesses.</p>
<p t="497330" d="2600">Heads or tails, that's for you.</p>
<p t="499930" d="1469">Heads or tails,
the guess for you.</p>
<p t="501399" d="1291">And you get a heads or a tails.</p>
<p t="502690" d="1580">So instead of writing
it down, you're</p>
<p t="504270" d="1800">going to sort of
hide those, maybe</p>
<p t="506070" d="1750">get some advice from
the class, and you're</p>
<p t="507820" d="4589">going to pick one and put it on
the table here as your guess.</p>
<p t="512409" d="3241">And then one of you out
there is going to flip a coin</p>
<p t="515650" d="3259">and announce the
result. And then we're</p>
<p t="518909" d="3571">going to reveal their
guesses and the winners</p>
<p t="522480" d="2190">split the money.</p>
<p t="524670" d="3270">And if there's no winners,
well, they take their $2 back</p>
<p t="527940" d="1630">and they split the pot.</p>
<p t="529570" d="2950">So this is a very fair game.</p>
<p t="532520" d="2290">They make their
choices, you guys</p>
<p t="534810" d="2540">toss the coin, and the
winners share of the pot.</p>
<p t="537350" d="4300">If there's one, winner they get
$6, which is a profit of $4.</p>
<p t="541650" d="2830">Two winners, they each
get three, profit of one,</p>
<p t="544480" d="2310">the other one's out two bucks.</p>
<p t="546790" d="2150">Nobody wins, they get
their money back, profit 0.</p>
<p t="548940" d="2360">They all win, they get
their money back, profit 0.</p>
<p t="551300" d="2220">Is the game clear?</p>
<p t="553520" d="2290">Who's got a coin out there?</p>
<p t="555810" d="1220">You've got a coin?</p>
<p t="557030" d="840">Very good.</p>
<p t="557870" d="1640">Now you've got to
guess the coin.</p>
<p t="559510" d="3010">Don't show each
other your guesses.</p>
<p t="562520" d="3939">And put your guesses
on the table here.</p>
<p t="566459" d="1291">You get to pick heads or tails.</p>
<p t="567750" d="833">Put it on the table.</p>
<p t="575270" d="1350">[LAUGHS]</p>
<p t="576620" d="1330">This is not a hard game.</p>
<p t="581140" d="3570">You got a heads
and a tails, right?</p>
<p t="584710" d="3488">Well, yeah, did you put a
heads or a tails in there?</p>
<p t="588198" d="3452">Yeah, there's one
heads, one tails.</p>
<p t="591650" d="770">No, that's blank.</p>
<p t="592420" d="1489">You don't win that way.</p>
<p t="593909" d="541">There you go.</p>
<p t="594450" d="708">That's the tails.</p>
<p t="595158" d="1782">AUDIENCE: I thought you meant--</p>
<p t="596940" d="750">PROFESSOR: Heads.</p>
<p t="597690" d="1728">So if you want heads,
you go like that.</p>
<p t="599418" d="428">AUDIENCE: Yeah.</p>
<p t="599846" d="1714">I thought you meant
do it the other way.</p>
<p t="601560" d="785">PROFESSOR: There you go.</p>
<p t="602345" d="1860">AUDIENCE: All right, I'll have
to make these indistinguishable</p>
<p t="604205" d="935">now.</p>
<p t="605140" d="1000">PROFESSOR: Well, yeah.</p>
<p t="606140" d="2890">One of them is
all ripped up now.</p>
<p t="609030" d="2460">They already guessed, so they've
already done their guess.</p>
<p t="611490" d="1310">So you pick one
and put it there.</p>
<p t="612800" d="1625">AUDIENCE: This is
what I was originally</p>
<p t="614425" d="1572">going to guess anyway.</p>
<p t="615997" d="1083">PROFESSOR: So that's good.</p>
<p t="617080" d="7610">And you now flip the coin
and tell us what it came out.</p>
<p t="624690" d="872">AUDIENCE: Heads.</p>
<p t="625562" d="708">PROFESSOR: Heads.</p>
<p t="626270" d="1541">All right, let's
reveal your choices.</p>
<p t="630280" d="1650">All right, so there's one heads.</p>
<p t="631930" d="3850">Martyna takes all the money.</p>
<p t="635780" d="1597">Just bad luck there, right?</p>
<p t="637377" d="1083">We're going to play again.</p>
<p t="638460" d="1333">We're going to play a few times.</p>
<p t="639793" d="3697">But let's start recording
what happened here.</p>
<p t="643490" d="3360">So the coin came out heads.</p>
<p t="646850" d="1155">OK, remind me your name?</p>
<p t="648005" d="625">AUDIENCE: Adam.</p>
<p t="648630" d="2320">PROFESSOR: Adam gassed tails.</p>
<p t="654850" d="1211">And Martyna.</p>
<p t="659230" d="2060">Is it Y?</p>
<p t="661290" d="6390">Martyna guessed heads and
Nick, he also loses at tails.</p>
<p t="667680" d="6100">So in this case Adam is out $2.</p>
<p t="673780" d="3020">Martyna got a profit of $4.</p>
<p t="676800" d="3430">And Nick is also down $2.</p>
<p t="680230" d="2570">All right, let's try it again.</p>

<p t="727560" d="920">All right, good job.</p>
<p t="728480" d="3026">OK, Adam got heads and
Martyna's on a roll here.</p>
<p t="731506" d="1124">So we got to split this up.</p>
<p t="732630" d="1730">Can you make change
for him here?</p>
<p t="734360" d="1720">He gets $3.</p>
<p t="736080" d="2670">So it was heads.</p>
<p t="738750" d="5120">Adam had heads, Martyna has
heads, and Nick's in trouble.</p>
<p t="743870" d="4310">Nick's off another
$2 of my money.</p>
<p t="748180" d="4510">Martyna is up $1 because she
wagered two and got three</p>

here for that one.</p>
<p t="757570" d="1850">All right, let's make
another selection.</p>
<p t="759420" d="2280">Heads or tails?</p>

<p t="792191" d="2889">Is there any catch going on?</p>
<p t="795080" d="1500">Not that we would
have a catch here.</p>
<p t="796580" d="2570">OK, put a heads or tails down.</p>
<p t="799150" d="1325">OK, coin toss please.</p>

<p t="806160" d="4990">A winner, a winner, and a loser.</p>
<p t="811150" d="3980">So we got tails, tails, tails.</p>
<p t="815130" d="5080">Nick has lost another $2.</p>
<p t="820210" d="3630">Martyna's cruising and
Adam is back to even.</p>

<p t="845870" d="2230">OK.</p>
<p t="848100" d="3050">See, my hope is
Nick loses track.</p>
<p t="851150" d="1960">OK, make a choice please.</p>

<p t="989960" d="3960">Start paying off the debts,

<p t="995690" d="1177">Yeah, there's a last one.</p>

<p t="1019670" d="1260">How'd you do?</p>
<p t="1020930" d="1180">Oh Adam, tough break.</p>
<p t="1022110" d="1470">Nick again.</p>
<p t="1023580" d="1279">Nick is the sole winner.</p>
<p t="1024859" d="2021">So he collects on the heads.</p>
<p t="1031440" d="5679">All right, so it's plus $4
for Nick, minus 2 for Martina,</p>
<p t="1037119" d="2761">minus 2 for Adam.</p>
<p t="1039880" d="3100">All right, let's see
how they did in total.</p>
<p t="1042980" d="1040">Oh, poor Adam.</p>
<p t="1044020" d="2920">Minus $6 here.</p>
<p t="1046940" d="860">How did that happen?</p>
<p t="1047800" d="4760">Martyna is plus $6.</p>
<p t="1052560" d="2010">Now we know how it happened.</p>
<p t="1054570" d="3085">And Nick is even.</p>
<p t="1060266" d="500">Even.</p>
<p t="1066950" d="3100">Yeah, so that's just a
tough break for Adam.</p>
<p t="1070050" d="3609">He came up here and lost $6.</p>
<p t="1073659" d="2041">AUDIENCE: Interestingly,
there's $6 on the table.</p>
<p t="1075700" d="1458">I think I should
take that and run.</p>
<p t="1077158" d="621">[LAUGHS]</p>
<p t="1077779" d="1541">PROFESSOR: Yeah,
you probably should.</p>
<p t="1079320" d="3180">But I need to get paid
back from Nick here.</p>
<p t="1082500" d="3920">Now obviously this is
a fair game, right?</p>
<p t="1086420" d="2340">So how many people think
that Adam was just unlucky?</p>
<p t="1092010" d="1000">A few.</p>
<p t="1093010" d="4440">How many people think we
just screwed him out of $6?</p>
<p t="1097450" d="1550">Yeah, you're right.</p>
<p t="1099000" d="4260">But let's do the analysis
to see what happened here.</p>
<p t="1103260" d="2896">Meanwhile, I probably
should give him his $6.</p>
<p t="1106156" d="2904">AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p t="1109060" d="2316">PROFESSOR: And you got my money.</p>

<p t="1144310" d="2700">Want to pass that up
for our coin tosser?</p>
<p t="1147010" d="830">OK, very good.</p>
<p t="1147840" d="2407">Thanks very much.</p>
<p t="1150247" d="1083">Just leave the money here.</p>
<p t="1151330" d="1047">Yeah.</p>
<p t="1152377" d="833">Leave my money here.</p>
<p t="1153210" d="1210">Oh, we took some
out of your wallet.</p>
<p t="1154420" d="1656">AUDIENCE: I got $5
money from you-- $5.</p>
<p t="1156076" d="1792">PROFESSOR: $5 from me, yeah.</p>
<p t="1157868" d="1444">All right, so leave me the $5.</p>
<p t="1159312" d="2360">AUDIENCE: This is your $5.</p>
<p t="1161672" d="2898">PROFESSOR: Oh, I should
give them back their $6.</p>
<p t="1164570" d="1734">Well, otherwise they
could report me,</p>
<p t="1166304" d="916">and I'd be in trouble.</p>
<p t="1167220" d="1230">And it's all on film.</p>
<p t="1168450" d="2670">That would not be good.</p>
<p t="1171120" d="4870">OK, so what we're going to
do now is analyze the game.</p>
<p t="1175990" d="2330">And I'm going to
prove to you he was</p>
<p t="1178320" d="2200">just unlucky, despite
the fact that you</p>
<p t="1180520" d="2310">think I screwed him here.</p>
<p t="1182830" d="3900">So we're going to analyze
Adam's expected winnings</p>
<p t="1186730" d="2180">playing this game.</p>
<p t="1188910" d="930">So let's do that.</p>
<p t="1192600" d="3280">So we're going to make
the tree, as usual.</p>
<p t="1195880" d="4620">Now, the first thing we
have is Adam's choice.</p>
<p t="1200500" d="1967">Now, Adam were you doing
anything besides sort</p>
<p t="1202467" d="833">of randomly picking?</p>
<p t="1203300" d="1583">Were you trying to
psych out the coin?</p>
<p t="1207784" d="2166">AUDIENCE: Apparently I
wouldn't be able to bribe him</p>
<p t="1209950" d="1420">from all the way down here.</p>
<p t="1211370" d="1910">PROFESSOR: Yeah, and
you did lose most of it.</p>
<p t="1213280" d="3590">We'll say Adam
was playing 50-50.</p>
<p t="1216870" d="1980">It's a reasonable assumption.</p>
<p t="1218850" d="3700">And then we have
Martyna and then</p>
<p t="1222550" d="3460">we have Nick and their choices.</p>
<p t="1226010" d="3520">And let's say they're 50-50
as well, because none of them</p>
<p t="1229530" d="1750">know what coin is
going to be tossed.</p>
<p t="1231280" d="2291">And I'm not going to draw
this bottom half of the tree,</p>
<p t="1233571" d="1429">but it's totally symmetric.</p>
<p t="1235000" d="3060">It just gets too deep otherwise.</p>
<p t="1238060" d="7170">And then we have Nick's choices,
heads, tails, heads, tails.</p>
<p t="1245230" d="797">And they're 50-50.</p>
<p t="1250342" d="1083">And then we have the coin.</p>
<p t="1253941" d="1499">And I'll start
drawing it down here.</p>
<p t="1255440" d="1757">And the coin can
be heads or tails.</p>
<p t="1257197" d="1833">And we're going to
assume it was a fair coin</p>
<p t="1259030" d="1750">toss back there, because
it looked like it</p>
<p t="1260780" d="1540">was flipping a bunch of times.</p>
<p t="1262320" d="2320">And you don't look
like Persi Diaconis,</p>
<p t="1264640" d="1600">so we're going to
assume you didn't</p>
<p t="1266240" d="2910">learn how to flip heads always.</p>
<p t="1269150" d="968">So those are 50-50.</p>
<p t="1273790" d="2540">A little tight here.</p>
<p t="1276330" d="1040">Everything is 50-50.</p>
<p t="1283040" d="4640">So the probabilities
are all 1/16.</p>
<p t="1287680" d="2990">I got 16 possible outcomes.</p>
<p t="1290670" d="1660">2 by 2 by 2 by 2.</p>
<p t="1292330" d="1714">They're all equally likely.</p>
<p t="1294044" d="1416">So all the
probabilities are 1/16.</p>
<p t="1301970" d="3410">And now let's see the winnings.</p>
<p t="1305380" d="3577">So we'll take Adam's game.</p>
<p t="1308957" d="1250">It'll turn out to be negative.</p>
<p t="1313790" d="4650">Now, in this case if Adam's
heads and Martyna and Nick</p>
<p t="1318440" d="4550">are heads and the coin comes
up heads, they all win,</p>
<p t="1322990" d="890">they split the pot.</p>
<p t="1323880" d="3790">So how much is the gain
for Adam in that case?</p>
<p t="1327670" d="2960">0.</p>
<p t="1330630" d="3970">Now they all guessed heads,
but the coin comes out tails,</p>
<p t="1334600" d="1120">so they split the pot.</p>
<p t="1335720" d="3430">What's Adam's gain there?</p>
<p t="1339150" d="2090">0, because they just
split the pot again.</p>
<p t="1341240" d="1110">He gets his $2 back.</p>
<p t="1342350" d="2660">That's 0.</p>
<p t="1345010" d="4420">Now we have a case
where Nick is tails,</p>
<p t="1349430" d="3670">Adam and Martyna were heads,
and it comes out heads.</p>
<p t="1353100" d="1770">So Nick is losing here.</p>
<p t="1354870" d="2630">The pot is split by
Adam and Martyna.</p>
<p t="1357500" d="3040">What does Adam get as a profit?</p>
<p t="1360540" d="500">1.</p>
<p t="1361040" d="2250">He gets half the part because
he splits with Martyna.</p>
<p t="1363290" d="5790">That's $3 he put into,
he gets 1, plus 1.</p>
<p t="1369080" d="2630">Now it turns out same
scenario of guesses,</p>
<p t="1371710" d="3030">but it comes out tails,
so Nick wins everything.</p>
<p t="1374740" d="2810">What's Adam's status here?</p>
<p t="1377550" d="810">Minus 2.</p>
<p t="1378360" d="3440">He bet $2, he lost it.</p>
<p t="1381800" d="5200">Then we have heads for
Adam, tails for Martyna,</p>
<p t="1387000" d="1330">heads for Nick.</p>
<p t="1388330" d="7220">Coin comes up heads, Adam splits
with Nick, he gets a net of $1.</p>
<p t="1395550" d="1750">Same scenario
guesses, but now it's</p>
<p t="1397300" d="5470">tails, so Martina wins
everything, Adam loses $2.</p>
<p t="1402770" d="1410">Now we go down to
here where it's</p>
<p t="1404180" d="4470">heads for Adam, tails
for Martyna and Nick,</p>
<p t="1408650" d="2870">and heads comes up, so
Adam wins the whole thing.</p>
<p t="1411520" d="2910">What does he get in this case?</p>
<p t="1414430" d="590">Plus 4.</p>
<p t="1415020" d="1620">He wins the whole
part of 6 minus 2.</p>
<p t="1416640" d="1770">So he gets 4 net.</p>
<p t="1418410" d="4280">And then lastly, in this
scenario it comes up tails</p>
<p t="1422690" d="4230">and Martina and Nick
split the pot, Adam loses.</p>
<p t="1426920" d="1890">Minus 2.</p>
<p t="1428810" d="3220">And then the same thing
is happening down here.</p>
<p t="1432030" d="830">Same thing.</p>
<p t="1432860" d="3940">It's just everything is
reversed by symmetry.</p>
<p t="1436800" d="2490">Now, they're all equally likely.</p>
<p t="1439290" d="2090">So what we do to compute
the expected gain</p>
<p t="1441380" d="3910">is take each value times its
probability and add them up.</p>
<p t="1445290" d="3130">So 0 times 1/16
plus 0 times 1/16</p>
<p t="1448420" d="3770">plus 1 times 1/16 minus 2
times 1/16 and so forth.</p>
<p t="1452190" d="3260">So it's easier just to add
these up and multiply by 1/16.</p>
<p t="1455450" d="2980">And when we do, we get 0.</p>
<p t="1458430" d="1640">We get 0.</p>
<p t="1460070" d="1440">If I add all these up, I get 0.</p>
<p t="1461510" d="1910">The same thing for down here.</p>
<p t="1463420" d="10630">So the expected
gain for Adam is 0.</p>
<p t="1474050" d="1791">And that is a fair game.</p>
<p t="1479320" d="1426">What do you think?</p>
<p t="1480746" d="1874">Do you think we'd go to
all that trouble just</p>
<p t="1482620" d="1050">to play a fair game?</p>
<p t="1483670" d="3130">Or do you think we're trying to
set him up and take his money?</p>
<p t="1486800" d="1866">Yeah.</p>
<p t="1488666" d="3224">AUDIENCE: Martyna and
Nick are alternating,</p>
<p t="1491890" d="1934">so the branch with
the plus 4 goes away.</p>
<p t="1493824" d="1416">PROFESSOR: Oh,
that's interesting.</p>
<p t="1495240" d="1156">Look what happened here.</p>
<p t="1499588" d="9762">Nick and Martina,
well, they're opposite.</p>
<p t="1509350" d="1940">That's opposite.</p>
<p t="1511290" d="800">That's opposite.</p>
<p t="1512090" d="2090">That's opposite.</p>
<p t="1514180" d="1870">You don't suppose they
planned that, do you?</p>
<p t="1519610" d="3010">And how could that possibly
help that they just</p>
<p t="1522620" d="1794">happened to guess opposite?</p>
<p t="1524414" d="1416">AUDIENCE: One of
them always wins.</p>
<p t="1525830" d="2090">PROFESSOR: One of
them always wins.</p>
<p t="1527920" d="2036">And what does that
mean for poor Adam?</p>
<p t="1529956" d="1624">AUDIENCE: He never
takes the whole pot.</p>
<p t="1531580" d="3080">PROFESSOR: He never
takes the whole pot.</p>
<p t="1534660" d="1770">Well, all right.</p>
<p t="1536430" d="3620">Let's see if that
changed anything here.</p>
<p t="1540050" d="3900">So if Nick and
Martyna are always</p>
<p t="1543950" d="4310">opposite, that means some of
these branches can't occur.</p>
<p t="1548260" d="3500">So if Martyna's heads,
Nick is tails, this is out.</p>
<p t="1551760" d="3340">So this is happening
with probability 1 now.</p>
<p t="1555100" d="7110">So these points are at
1/8 each instead of 1/16.</p>
<p t="1562210" d="4560">And these go to 0 because
that branch can't happen.</p>
<p t="1566770" d="720">Same thing here.</p>
<p t="1567490" d="3800">When you go tails to
Martyna, Nick can't be tails,</p>
<p t="1571290" d="1820">has to be heads.</p>
<p t="1573110" d="3480">So these go to 1/8.</p>
<p t="1576590" d="1165">These go to 0.</p>
<p t="1581180" d="3010">Now, you notice this isn't
working out so well for Adam</p>
<p t="1584190" d="2640">because we're putting
more weight here</p>
<p t="1586830" d="4920">where he's got a net negative
compared to an even situation.</p>
<p t="1591750" d="3450">And here he's gone from a
positive situation, that's</p>
<p t="1595200" d="2180">getting wiped out
to a net negative.</p>
<p t="1597380" d="2580">So let's compute
his probability now.</p>
<p t="1599960" d="2520">And I'll get the same
contribution down here.</p>
<p t="1602480" d="7280">I've got 1 minus 2 plus 1
of 0 minus 2 is negative 2.</p>
<p t="1609760" d="3000">I'll get a negative 2
down here times 1/8.</p>
<p t="1612760" d="2320">In this case, I'll
have the expected gain</p>
<p t="1615080" d="5250">for Adam is going to be minus.</p>
<p t="1620330" d="1940">Let's make sure I do this right.</p>
<p t="1622270" d="6860">It's going to be 2 for the
top and bottom times 1/8</p>
<p t="1629130" d="3430">times these guys.</p>
<p t="1632560" d="4550">1 minus 2 plus 1 minus 2.</p>
<p t="1637110" d="3780">And that equals minus 2.</p>
<p t="1640890" d="990">That's minus 1/2.</p>
<p t="1647540" d="4060">So in fact, if they come up
here and guess differently,</p>
<p t="1651600" d="1730">who knew?</p>
<p t="1653330" d="3280">Now the expected gain
for Adam is minus $0.50.</p>
<p t="1656610" d="5810">Every time he plays, he expects
to lose $0.50 on his $2 bet.</p>
<p t="1662420" d="3870">That's a lousy game for
Adam to be playing, even</p>
<p t="1666290" d="4540">though it seemed very fair.</p>
<p t="1670830" d="1850">You see what's going on here?</p>
<p t="1672680" d="6110">Now, this kind of trick is used
in all sorts of gambling games.</p>
<p t="1678790" d="2000">Maybe you've probably
played some of these games</p>
<p t="1680790" d="1833">and may not have realized
maybe somebody was</p>
<p t="1682623" d="2617">using this trick against you.</p>
<p t="1685240" d="1400">For example, how
many of you have</p>
<p t="1686640" d="3784">been in some kind of
sports betting pool?</p>
<p t="1690424" d="1416">It's March Madness,
you're betting</p>
<p t="1691840" d="3510">on the victors in round one.</p>
<p t="1695350" d="1830">It's a football pool
for the weekend.</p>
<p t="1697180" d="1370">You're going to guess
against the spread.</p>
<p t="1698550" d="791">Who's going to win?</p>
<p t="1699341" d="2079">All right, some of
you have done that.</p>
<p t="1701420" d="2740">All right, now everybody
puts $1 into the pool.</p>
<p t="1704160" d="2950">And the winner is the
guy who was the most wins</p>
<p t="1707110" d="1220">or games picked right.</p>
<p t="1708330" d="2910">All the winners split the pot.</p>
<p t="1711240" d="3140">Now, what this says, by doing
the same kind of analysis we</p>
<p t="1714380" d="5050">just did, is that if you
collude with one or two or three</p>
<p t="1719430" d="3830">other players in the pool
to always pick differently</p>
<p t="1723260" d="3910">on all the games, it's
going to give you an edge.</p>
<p t="1727170" d="1160">Same reasoning.</p>
<p t="1728330" d="2950">When they pick differently,
it gives them an edge</p>
<p t="1731280" d="3300">and now your expected
return is bigger than 0,</p>
<p t="1734580" d="2500">at the expense of
the other players who</p>
<p t="1737080" d="2560">just go in and are
putting their picks, if we</p>
<p t="1739640" d="2700">assume each one is 50-50.</p>
<p t="1742340" d="4250">In fact, a former professor
of statistics here at MIT</p>
<p t="1746590" d="5440">used this idea, a guy named
Herman Chernoff, in the 1980s</p>
<p t="1752030" d="3160">to beat the state lottery.</p>
<p t="1755190" d="2410">Now, everyone knows
that lotteries</p>
<p t="1757600" d="2830">are the worst game around
because everybody puts</p>
<p t="1760430" d="3650">the money in, the
state takes half,</p>
<p t="1764080" d="2770">and then the winners
split the pot.</p>
<p t="1766850" d="1690">So it's a horrendous game.</p>
<p t="1768540" d="2650">Your expected return is
half of what you put in.</p>
<p t="1771190" d="2660">So you expect to lose half your
bet, because the state's taking</p>
<p t="1773850" d="4980">half and splitting the remainder
among all the participants.</p>
<p t="1778830" d="6340">Now, what Chernoff realized is
that people don't bet randomly.</p>
<p t="1785170" d="4370">They tend to pick the
same sets of numbers.</p>
<p t="1789540" d="1240">It might be a birthday.</p>
<p t="1790780" d="3720">There's only so many
birthdays out there.</p>
<p t="1794500" d="3160">Might be number of
home runs Papi's hit,</p>
<p t="1797660" d="2870">his batting average,
Pabelbon's ERA.</p>
<p t="1800530" d="2570">Who knows?</p>
<p t="1803100" d="2780">But they pick a
relatively small set</p>
<p t="1805880" d="2740">of numbers that
tend to collapse on.</p>
<p t="1808620" d="5750">In fact, if you graph
how people tend to pick.</p>
<p t="1814370" d="1640">And say you're
playing pick four,</p>
<p t="1816010" d="2177">where you pick four numbers.</p>
<p t="1818187" d="1833">And now you look at the
frequency with which</p>
<p t="1820020" d="1670">the numbers are picked.</p>
<p t="1821690" d="3400">Very crudely it looks
something like this.</p>
<p t="1825090" d="2140">Every once in a while
you get a hot ticket</p>
<p t="1827230" d="4660">where a lot of people
pick that number.</p>
<p t="1831890" d="2050">For example, if you're
picking four numbers,</p>
<p t="1833940" d="5482">MIT students might
pick 2, 4, 6, 16.</p>
<p t="1839422" d="1958">They might pick that and
so it'd be a big spike</p>
<p t="1841380" d="1690">for that set of four.</p>
<p t="1843070" d="4204">Down the street they're
probably picking in 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
<p t="1847274" d="1916">Something like that and
there's a spike there.</p>
<p t="1852280" d="3270">If you knew this was
the histogram of what</p>
<p t="1855550" d="3090">people were picking and
you knew half the pot was</p>
<p t="1858640" d="4790">going to get split with the
winners, what would you pick?</p>
<p t="1863430" d="1785">Would you pick these?</p>
<p t="1865215" d="2375">No, because now you're splitting
the pot with 100 people.</p>
<p t="1867590" d="1600">That's no good.</p>
<p t="1869190" d="2450">You pick down here.</p>
<p t="1871640" d="3562">And now when you win,
you get half the pot.</p>
<p t="1875202" d="1958">The state always takes
half, but you don't have</p>
<p t="1877160" d="2310">to split it with anybody else.</p>
<p t="1879470" d="2480">And that means if you're
picking down here,</p>
<p t="1881950" d="3870">your expected
return is positive,</p>
<p t="1885820" d="1820">even with the state taking half.</p>
<p t="1887640" d="4690">Because so much of the money
is piled up in these things.</p>
<p t="1892330" d="4580">And so Chernoff proved
that in fact, he</p>
<p t="1896910" d="2640">didn't know which
numbers were popular.</p>
<p t="1899550" d="1410">He didn't know that.</p>
<p t="1900960" d="1049">So what did he do?</p>
<p t="1902009" d="2041">If you don't know where
the spikes are but you're</p>
<p t="1904050" d="2300">trying to avoid them and
there's not very many spikes,</p>
<p t="1906350" d="3120">what would you do to avoid them?</p>
<p t="1909470" d="2167">Pick random.</p>
<p t="1911637" d="2333">Because if you pick random,
probably you miss the spike.</p>
<p t="1913970" d="1710">You're down here.</p>
<p t="1915680" d="2000">With a number nobody would
have thought to pick,</p>
<p t="1917680" d="1750">if some random number.</p>
<p t="1919430" d="2810">And he showed that, in
fact, if you pick randomly,</p>
<p t="1922240" d="4630">your expected gain for
the lottery at the time</p>
<p t="1926870" d="3630">was 7%, or $0.7 on the dollar.</p>
<p t="1930500" d="3000">So positive even with
the state taking half.</p>
<p t="1933500" d="3660">Now, shortly after that,
you saw the proliferation</p>
<p t="1937160" d="3810">of these random machines that
we create random numbers.</p>
<p t="1940970" d="2120">Because the state wanted
to balance it out and not</p>
<p t="1943090" d="2220">have this kind of a scenario.</p>
<p t="1945310" d="1600">So now a lot of the
picks are randomly</p>
<p t="1946910" d="2660">generated in a lot
of the lotteries.</p>
<p t="1954210" d="2070">These things are not
immediately obvious,</p>
<p t="1956280" d="5960">but become very clear once you
know the mathematics behind it.</p>
<p t="1962240" d="1620">Any questions?</p>
<p t="1963860" d="785">Yeah.</p>
<p t="1964645" d="3255">AUDIENCE: How would a
person hit a random number?</p>
<p t="1967900" d="1970">PROFESSOR: Oh, you go to
your favorite computer</p>
<p t="1969870" d="2420">and do a random
number generator.</p>
<p t="1972290" d="2200">Now, that's not
perfectly random.</p>
<p t="1974490" d="1560">People do get into
a science of this</p>
<p t="1976050" d="2462">where they're
certain cosmic rays</p>
<p t="1978512" d="1958">or whatever hitting the
earth and the frequency</p>
<p t="1980470" d="1666">they try to get random
numbers out of it</p>
<p t="1982136" d="2084">or certain kinds
of clocks and stuff</p>
<p t="1984220" d="2870">like that, the tiny
low order bits.</p>
<p t="1987090" d="2979">Actually getting really
independent random numbers</p>
<p t="1990069" d="791">can be challenging.</p>
<p t="1990860" d="2280">A lot of the things you do
with a computer generating</p>
<p t="1993140" d="3000">random numbers, they're
distributed nicely,</p>
<p t="1996140" d="1710">but they're not
mutually independent.</p>
<p t="1997850" d="2400">And there's whole texts
that go into how to do</p>
<p t="2000250" d="2135">that for mutual independence.</p>
<p t="2002385" d="1875">Getting something that's
fair for one of them</p>
<p t="2004260" d="2840">is not too hard.</p>
<p t="2007100" d="3820">Any questions about that?</p>
<p t="2010920" d="2050">There's another example.</p>
<p t="2012970" d="1950">How many people
ever participated</p>
<p t="2014920" d="3170">in a Super Bowl bet?</p>
<p t="2018090" d="2720">OK, like maybe you're trying to
guess the over under on point</p>
<p t="2020810" d="2120">scored.</p>
<p t="2022930" d="4120">And the person who guesses close
to the total number of points</p>
<p t="2027050" d="1320">wins the pot.</p>
<p t="2028370" d="2390">And if there's a
tie, it's shared.</p>
<p t="2030760" d="2730">So in that kind of
situation, some people</p>
<p t="2033490" d="3080">figured out that the average
number of points scored</p>
<p t="2036570" d="4290">in a Super Bowl is, say, 30.</p>
<p t="2040860" d="6870">And a lot of the guesses then
will cluster around 30 points.</p>
<p t="2047730" d="3110">Now, if you knew this and you
knew a lot of the guesses,</p>
<p t="2050840" d="2799">because there may be people who
cared betting, where would you</p>
<p t="2053639" d="2921">make, say, this is, I don't
know, 40 and this is 20,</p>
<p t="2056560" d="2880">where would you guess?</p>
<p t="2059440" d="1040">You could guess here.</p>
<p t="2060480" d="1640">That's a good one.</p>
<p t="2062120" d="2500">Or you could guess here.</p>
<p t="2064620" d="2828">Not only are you not going to
share the pot, which helps you,</p>
<p t="2067448" d="2291">but in this case you'd
actually, because being closest,</p>
<p t="2069739" d="2891">you'd capture all
the scores out here.</p>
<p t="2072630" d="2240">So that's really good.</p>
<p t="2074870" d="3328">So these are the best guesses to
make for your expected return,</p>
<p t="2078198" d="2291">assuming everybody is guessing
around here because they</p>
<p t="2080489" d="1391">know that's the median.</p>
<p t="2081880" d="966">Yeah?</p>
<p t="2082846" d="2538">AUDIENCE: But those scores
aren't likely to happen.</p>
<p t="2085384" d="1666">PROFESSOR: They're
not likely to happen,</p>
<p t="2087050" d="4109">but it can outweigh splitting
the pot with all the people</p>
<p t="2091159" d="2711">that guessed here.</p>
<p t="2093870" d="2874">And you get to cover more bases.</p>
<p t="2096744" d="1916">So you're right, they're
less likely to happen</p>
<p t="2098660" d="3510">because so many people guessed
in here where it's likely.</p>
<p t="2102170" d="3620">Your expected return
is better out here.</p>
<p t="2105790" d="2960">You may not be likely
to win, but your payoff</p>
<p t="2108750" d="3040">will be very large when you do.</p>
<p t="2111790" d="2800">Now, if you're in
a bet or a pool</p>
<p t="2114590" d="2810">with a bunch of 6042
students and they're all</p>
<p t="2117400" d="5142">guessing out here, well then
you want to go back home here.</p>
<p t="2122542" d="708">Then it's better.</p>
<p t="2123250" d="5550">So it all depends on what
that distribution looks like.</p>
<p t="2128800" d="2860">All right, any more
questions about this?</p>
<p t="2131660" d="1012">Yeah.</p>
<p t="2132672" d="1541">AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
if you're going</p>
<p t="2134213" d="1670">to be playing a
whole bunch of times,</p>
<p t="2135883" d="1875">and if you're only
playing once, wouldn't you</p>
<p t="2137758" d="2400">look at the most likely result?</p>
<p t="2140158" d="1250">PROFESSOR: Say that again now?</p>
<p t="2141408" d="2521">AUDIENCE: If you're going to be
only playing once wouldn't you</p>
<p t="2143929" d="1666">only be concerned
with the result that's</p>
<p t="2145595" d="2011">most likely to show up?</p>
<p t="2147606" d="1874">PROFESSOR: Well, it
depends on your strategy.</p>
<p t="2149480" d="3100">If you want the expected
gain to be maximized,</p>
<p t="2152580" d="2180">it doesn't matter how
many times you're playing.</p>
<p t="2154760" d="2640">And that can be very
different than maximizing</p>
<p t="2157400" d="2080">your probability of winning.</p>
<p t="2159480" d="2730">If you want to maximize
your probability of winning,</p>
<p t="2162210" d="3955">you're going to go right
at the center point here.</p>
<p t="2166165" d="2125">Because if you look at the
probability distribution</p>
<p t="2168290" d="4282">and say the probability
distribution looks like that,</p>
<p t="2172572" d="1708">then you want to bet
here, because that's</p>
<p t="2174280" d="3110">the maximum chance of winning.</p>
<p t="2177390" d="4860">But say so many people bet
there, you'd split 30 ways.</p>
<p t="2182250" d="5010">Well, this divided by 30 is
smaller than this divided by 1.</p>
<p t="2187260" d="4020">And so your expected return
will be bigger out here.</p>
<p t="2191280" d="1220">So two different things.</p>
<p t="2192500" d="2660">Maximizing the probability
of winning and maximizing</p>
<p t="2195160" d="1670">your expected return.</p>
<p t="2196830" d="564">Yeah?</p>
<p t="2197394" d="1416">AUDIENCE: When you
say maximizing,</p>
<p t="2198810" d="2334">do you just do derivatives?</p>
<p t="2201144" d="1916">PROFESSOR: Yeah, then
you could do derivatives</p>
<p t="2203060" d="780">and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p t="2203840" d="510">That's right.</p>
<p t="2204350" d="1791">Once you have the curve,
you figure it out.</p>
<p t="2206141" d="1679">Yeah.</p>
<p t="2207820" d="731">Yeah.</p>
<p t="2208551" d="1791">AUDIENCE: Wouldn't it
be better to maximize</p>
<p t="2210342" d="5773">your expected value versus
the probability that you win?</p>
<p t="2216115" d="625">PROFESSOR: Yes.</p>
<p t="2216740" d="4420">In general, you want to
maximize the expected return</p>
<p t="2221160" d="2010">on the basis that
probably over life you're</p>
<p t="2223170" d="1780">doing lots of things.</p>
<p t="2224950" d="2040">And that overall puts
you in a better state.</p>
<p t="2226990" d="2120">Now, we're going
to talk about this</p>
<p t="2229110" d="5640">some next time in terms
of taking high risk</p>
<p t="2234750" d="3110">bets with high, high payoffs.</p>
<p t="2237860" d="2510">That can maximize
your expected return,</p>
<p t="2240370" d="2860">but you have a very decent
chance of losing a lot.</p>
<p t="2243230" d="1610">And so you might not
want to go there.</p>
<p t="2244840" d="1583">And we'll talk about
that next time we</p>
<p t="2246423" d="3367">talk about variance and
actually what your choice is.</p>
<p t="2249790" d="2320">Because that is a
fundamental choice you face.</p>
<p t="2252110" d="3650">Maximizing chance of winning,
maximizing expected return.</p>
<p t="2255760" d="2210">And of course, tied into
that is the risk of losing</p>
<p t="2257970" d="2041">and what kind of risk
you're willing to tolerate.</p>
<p t="2263530" d="3520">We're going to do a bunch more
examples, but before I do,</p>
<p t="2267050" d="1760">I want to show you
some other equivalent</p>
<p t="2268810" d="1130">definitions of expectation.</p>
<p t="2283650" d="2500">So the expected value
of a random variable,</p>
<p t="2286150" d="3140">you can also compute
it by summing over</p>
<p t="2289290" d="3110">all possible values of
the random variable.</p>
<p t="2292400" d="5200">x being in the range of
R. x times the probability</p>
<p t="2297600" d="2730">that R equals x.</p>
<p t="2300330" d="1870">And let's see why this is true.</p>
<p t="2302200" d="1858">It follows from the definition.</p>
<p t="2307600" d="2670">From the definition, we
know the expected value</p>
<p t="2310270" d="3330">is the sum over
all sample points</p>
<p t="2313600" d="2370">of the value of the random
variable on the sample</p>
<p t="2315970" d="1395">point times its probability.</p>
<p t="2319970" d="6910">And now we can organize this
sum by the value that R takes.</p>
<p t="2326880" d="3600">So we're going to split
this into a double sum</p>
<p t="2330480" d="6850">where here we're looking
first at x in the range of R.</p>
<p t="2337330" d="4700">And then here we look at
sample points for which R</p>
<p t="2342030" d="2350">on that point is x.</p>
<p t="2344380" d="2840">So this sum is
equivalent to this one.</p>
<p t="2347220" d="1750">Here we're just
organizing all the sample</p>
<p t="2348970" d="1375">points for the same value of x.</p>
<p t="2368990" d="3440">All right, now in
the inner sum, I've</p>
<p t="2372430" d="3710">only got values for which
R w equals x, so I can just</p>
<p t="2376140" d="1270">replace this with x.</p>
<p t="2390710" d="3150">The same as before.</p>
<p t="2393860" d="2715">Only now I've just
put x instead of Rw.</p>
<p t="2401750" d="4055">Now I can pull the x out since
it's a constant independent</p>
<p t="2405805" d="865">of that sum.</p>
<p t="2423070" d="4210">Now here I'm summing up the
probability of all the sample</p>
<p t="2427280" d="4820">points for which R of
the sample point is x.</p>
<p t="2432100" d="5790">And that is just the
probability that R equals x.</p>
<p t="2437890" d="2650">That's the definition of the
probability of that event.</p>
<p t="2440540" d="3770">And so now my answer
is some overall values</p>
<p t="2444310" d="3867">x in the range of x times
of probability R equals x.</p>
<p t="2448177" d="1583">And that's what I
was trying to prove.</p>
<p t="2455870" d="5120">OK, any questions about that?</p>
<p t="2460990" d="2240">Now there are some
special cases of this</p>
<p t="2463230" d="4687">when the random variable
is on the natural numbers.</p>
<p t="2467917" d="1708">So the range of R is
the natural numbers.</p>
<p t="2481960" d="671">So a corollary.</p>
<p t="2485400" d="8000">If the random variable has a
range on the natural numbers,</p>
<p t="2493400" d="4160">then another way to compute
the expected value of r</p>
<p t="2497560" d="6080">is to simply sum i equals
1 to infinity i times</p>
<p t="2503640" d="2120">the probability R equals i.</p>
<p t="2508330" d="2860">And the proof, well, it's really
just saying the same thing</p>
<p t="2511190" d="700">here.</p>
<p t="2511890" d="2270">I'm just summing over
the natural numbers.</p>
<p t="2514160" d="1980">And the case with
0 doesn't matter</p>
<p t="2516140" d="2690">because I get 0 times
the probability of 0.</p>
<p t="2518830" d="3560">And that adds
nothing to the sum.</p>
<p t="2522390" d="7000">So I just have to sum over the
positive integers in that case.</p>
<p t="2529390" d="2230">All right, there's
another special case</p>
<p t="2531620" d="3440">of this, which
makes it even easier</p>
<p t="2535060" d="2540">sometimes to compute
the expected value.</p>
<p t="2559910" d="6350">If R is a random variable
in the natural numbers,</p>
<p t="2566260" d="4310">then the expected
value of R is simply</p>
<p t="2570570" d="5670">the sum i equals 0 to
infinity of the probability</p>
<p t="2576240" d="4160">the random variable
is bigger than i.</p>
<p t="2580400" d="5355">Which is the same as summing
i equals 1 to infinity,</p>
<p t="2585755" d="3545">the probability R is
bigger than or equal to i.</p>
<p t="2589300" d="1777">They're the same thing.</p>
<p t="2591077" d="2083">For example, the first
term here, your probability</p>
<p t="2593160" d="1590">R bigger than 0.</p>
<p t="2594750" d="3760">That's the same as saying R
is bigger than or equal to 1</p>
<p t="2598510" d="710">and so forth.</p>
<p t="2599220" d="2780">So these are clearly the same.</p>
<p t="2602000" d="3760">And the difference
here is we have i times</p>
<p t="2605760" d="2470">probability R equals i.</p>
<p t="2608230" d="2760">Here we have probability
R is bigger than I,</p>
<p t="2610990" d="1130">with no i out in front.</p>
<p t="2612120" d="1208">So let's see why that's true.</p>
<p t="2637200" d="3260">Well, we're going to work
backwards and evaluate</p>
<p t="2640460" d="2370">that sum.</p>
<p t="2642830" d="10520">The sum i equal 0 to infinity
probability R is bigger than i.</p>
<p t="2653350" d="3900">Well, that's the
probability R is bigger</p>
<p t="2657250" d="4200">than 0 plus the
probability R is bigger</p>
<p t="2661450" d="6250">than 1 plus probability
R is bigger than 2,</p>
<p t="2667700" d="1433">and so forth out to infinity.</p>
<p t="2672610" d="2730">Adding those up.</p>
<p t="2675340" d="1570">And now I can
write this one out.</p>
<p t="2676910" d="6340">That's the probability R
equals 1 plus the probability R</p>
<p t="2683250" d="6416">equals 2 plus the probability
R equals 3 and so forth.</p>
<p t="2692450" d="5660">Probability are bigger than
1 equals, well, R could be 2,</p>
<p t="2698110" d="5650">R could be 3, and so forth.</p>
<p t="2703760" d="1700">R bigger than 2.</p>
<p t="2705460" d="6550">Well, R could be
3, 4, and so forth.</p>
<p t="2712010" d="6100">And so now if I
add all these up,</p>
<p t="2718110" d="5670">well, I get 1 times
probability R equals 1.</p>
<p t="2723780" d="1130">Two of these guys.</p>
<p t="2730810" d="1590">Three of these guys.</p>
<p t="2732400" d="1642">And you can see
the pattern here.</p>
<p t="2736970" d="2840">Before the next and so forth.</p>
<p t="2739810" d="5340">And so we've shown that this
value equals that value, which</p>
<p t="2745150" d="9485">is by the corollary just
the expected value of R.</p>
<p t="2754635" d="2375">So by the corollary, we know
that the expected value of R</p>
<p t="2757010" d="3178">equals the sum up there.</p>
<p t="2760188" d="1500">And that's the proof
of the theorem.</p>
<p t="2766900" d="4380">Sometimes it's easier to use
that top expression there.</p>
<p t="2771280" d="4330">And as a good example, it
gives a really easy way</p>
<p t="2775610" d="4080">to compute the mean time
to failure in a system.</p>
<p t="2779690" d="858">So let's do that.</p>
<p t="2790290" d="11730">Suppose you have a system and
it fails with probability p</p>
<p t="2802020" d="3190">at each step.</p>
<p t="2805210" d="1950">And let's assume
that the failures</p>
<p t="2807160" d="3340">are mutually independent.</p>
<p t="2810500" d="2840">So if the system has
been going for t steps,</p>
<p t="2813340" d="3360">it still will fail on step
t plus 1 with probability p,</p>
<p t="2816700" d="2680">no matter what's
happened before.</p>
<p t="2819380" d="3570">And the question is, what's
the expected number of steps</p>
<p t="2822950" d="1380">before the system fails?</p>
<p t="2824330" d="3350">How long is it going to
live before you get a crash?</p>
<p t="2827680" d="4040">And we're going to let R
be that random variable.</p>
<p t="2831720" d="5280">It will be the step when
failure occurs, first failure.</p>
<p t="2845120" d="3650">We want to know what's the
expected value of R. Mean time</p>
<p t="2848770" d="566">to failure.</p>
<p t="2852430" d="3920">And we're going to use
that top formula up there.</p>
<p t="2856350" d="2457">Makes it a lot
simpler to do that</p>
<p t="2858807" d="1125">than the other definitions.</p>
<p t="2865010" d="5120">Now, the probability
that R is bigger than i</p>
<p t="2870130" d="3390">is the same as the
probability it did not</p>
<p t="2873520" d="1876">fail in the first i steps.</p>
<p t="2878970" d="9495">So this equals the probability
of no failure in the first i</p>
<p t="2888465" d="500">steps.</p>
<p t="2893900" d="1940">Because this event,
R bigger than i</p>
<p t="2895840" d="4000">means that the first failure
was not in the first steps,</p>
<p t="2899840" d="3540">so the system was fine
for the first i steps.</p>
<p t="2903380" d="2590">And because of
mutual independence</p>
<p t="2905970" d="3140">on when failure
occurs, this is simply</p>
<p t="2909110" d="8030">the product that we're OK,
no failure in the first step</p>
<p t="2917140" d="1460">times the probability.</p>
<p t="2918600" d="9200">We're OK in the second step and
so forth up to the ith step.</p>
<p t="2927800" d="1334">We're OK in ith step.</p>
<p t="2932830" d="2210">And this is where we're
using mutual independence,</p>
<p t="2935040" d="2380">because I've gone
from a situation where</p>
<p t="2937420" d="1570">we're OK in the first i steps.</p>
<p t="2938990" d="3290">The probability of that is the
product of the probabilities.</p>
<p t="2942280" d="2580">We're OK in each
step individually.</p>
<p t="2944860" d="1353">So that needed independents.</p>
<p t="2949890" d="3520">Well, what is the probability
we're OK in the first step?</p>
<p t="2957610" d="3598">What's the probability of
no failure on step one?</p>
<p t="2961208" d="3742">1 minus p, because p is the
probability we did fail.</p>
<p t="2964950" d="3170">So we're OK with
probability 1 minus p.</p>
<p t="2968120" d="3810">What is the probability
we're OK in the second step?</p>
<p t="2971930" d="7110">1 minus p and so
forth for all i steps.</p>
<p t="2979040" d="3440">So this is 1 minus p to the eye.</p>
<p t="2982480" d="6480">And it's usually simpler to
write that as alpha to the i</p>
<p t="2988960" d="4240">where alpha equals 1 minus p.</p>
<p t="2993200" d="5950">Because what we've got
here now is the sum.</p>
<p t="2999150" d="3210">Expected value of R
is a sum, i equals 0</p>
<p t="3002360" d="8630">to infinity of that probability,
which is just alpha to the i.</p>
<p t="3010990" d="3290">And we all know what
that sum is, right?</p>
<p t="3014280" d="760">What's that sum?</p>
<p t="3019430" d="1555">1 over 1 minus alpha.</p>
<p t="3023640" d="3150">And that plug back in
the alpha to be 1 minus</p>
<p t="3026790" d="5912">p is 1 over 1 minus 1 minus p.</p>
<p t="3032702" d="958">And that's very simple.</p>
<p t="3033660" d="3640">That's 1 over p.</p>
<p t="3037300" d="3010">So the expected time to
fail, the expected step</p>
<p t="3040310" d="2900">of when you're going to
fail, is 1 over p where</p>
<p t="3043210" d="2290">p is the failure probability.</p>
<p t="3045500" d="4620">So for example, if you have a 1%
chance of failing on any step,</p>
<p t="3050120" d="4390">your mean time to
failure is what?</p>
<p t="3054510" d="812">100.</p>
<p t="3055322" d="1938">1 over 0.01.</p>
<p t="3057260" d="4610">So very easy to compute
mean time to failure.</p>
<p t="3061870" d="4394">Any questions about that?</p>
<p t="3066264" d="2166">Of course, you can do it
with the other definitions,</p>
<p t="3068430" d="3230">but the calculations are
a little more painful.</p>
<p t="3071660" d="913">Yeah.</p>
<p t="3072573" d="1333">AUDIENCE: Why are we summing it?</p>
<p t="3073906" d="3344">Is it like an accumulative
solution basically?</p>
<p t="3077250" d="1610">PROFESSOR: Why are we summing?</p>
<p t="3078860" d="1970">Well, that's the definition.</p>
<p t="3080830" d="5100">The theorem says the expected
value of a random variable</p>
<p t="3085930" d="4902">is the sum of the probability
that it's bigger than i.</p>
<p t="3090832" d="1208">That's what the theorem says.</p>
<p t="3092040" d="2500">So we're just plugging
into the theorem.</p>
<p t="3094540" d="2880">And then the theorem
was proved based</p>
<p t="3097420" d="4600">on the corollary, which came
from the theorem and then</p>
<p t="3102020" d="1109">the definition.</p>
<p t="3103129" d="1541">So we went through
a series of steps.</p>
<p t="3104670" d="2840">We started with a definition
of expected value, which</p>
<p t="3107510" d="1089">makes sense.</p>
<p t="3108599" d="1541">Then we got another
way to compute it</p>
<p t="3110140" d="1041">based on that definition.</p>
<p t="3113770" d="3012">And then a corollary
to that and then</p>
<p t="3116782" d="1708">we use the corollary
to prove another way</p>
<p t="3118490" d="1220">of computing expected values.</p>
<p t="3119710" d="2044">We went through a
bunch of general steps</p>
<p t="3121754" d="1916">and then we used, basically
you could use this</p>
<p t="3123670" d="2684">as a definition of this
point for expected value.</p>
<p t="3126354" d="1666">And it just says you
sum those things up</p>
<p t="3128020" d="958">and you get the answer.</p>
<p t="3132510" d="1058">Any other questions?</p>
<p t="3136990" d="2390">OK, there's a variation
on this problem</p>
<p t="3139380" d="3510">that you see all the time
in sort of trick questions</p>
<p t="3142890" d="2760">or in the popular
press sometime, that</p>
<p t="3145650" d="1570">often confuses people.</p>
<p t="3147220" d="2410">People sometimes think
of it as a paradox,</p>
<p t="3149630" d="2300">though it's not really one.</p>
<p t="3151930" d="2130">And the example's something
like the following.</p>
<p t="3154060" d="2550">Say that a couple, they're
going to have kids.</p>
<p t="3156610" d="2280">What they really
want is a baby girl.</p>
<p t="3158890" d="1500">They get a boy,
fine, but that's not</p>
<p t="3160390" d="1208">what they're concerned about.</p>
<p t="3161598" d="1842">They want to have a baby girl.</p>
<p t="3163440" d="1870">And let's say that
each time they have</p>
<p t="3165310" d="2990">a kid it's 50-50 boy or girl.</p>
<p t="3168300" d="3410">And let's say that it's
mutually independent from one</p>
<p t="3171710" d="2670">kid to the next, which
is not true in practice.</p>
<p t="3174380" d="1355">There tends to be correlation.</p>
<p t="3175735" d="2125">But let's assume it's
mutually independent from one</p>
<p t="3177860" d="1640">kid to the next.</p>
<p t="3179500" d="4250">Now, if on the first
try a couple get a girl,</p>
<p t="3183750" d="2360">great, they're done, they
have one kid, that's it,</p>
<p t="3186110" d="1570">because they just wanted a girl.</p>
<p t="3187680" d="3460">If they get a boy,
OK, try again.</p>
<p t="3191140" d="3750">And they keep trying again
until they get the girl,</p>
<p t="3194890" d="1590">even if it's 50 kids.</p>
<p t="3196480" d="2090">They wait till
they get the girl.</p>
<p t="3198570" d="3260">And the question is,
how many baby boys</p>
<p t="3201830" d="5360">do you expect to get
before you have the girl?</p>
<p t="3207190" d="500">what's?</p>
<p t="3207690" d="4771">The expected number of boys to
get the girl, then you quit?</p>
<p t="3212461" d="4870">So let's do that.</p>
<p t="3228070" d="1665">So we want to know.</p>
<p t="3229735" d="2955">We have the following data.</p>
<p t="3232690" d="5170">The probability of a boy is 1/2.</p>
<p t="3237860" d="2978">You keep having boys until
you get a girl, then you quit.</p>
<p t="3246840" d="3687">We're going to let R
be the random variable</p>
<p t="3250527" d="958">for the number of boys.</p>
<p t="3254050" d="7240">And everything is mutually
independent from one child</p>
<p t="3261290" d="2010">to the next.</p>
<p t="3263300" d="5130">How many people think you expect
to have more boys than the one</p>
<p t="3268430" d="1900">girl?</p>
<p t="3270330" d="2350">You keep having boys
till you get the girl.</p>
<p t="3272680" d="1200">Most people think this.</p>
<p t="3273880" d="5510">How many people think you expect
to have fewer than one boy?</p>
<p t="3279390" d="1240">Nobody.</p>
<p t="3280630" d="2506">How many people think you
expect to have an equal number?</p>
<p t="3283136" d="1024">Expect one boy.</p>
<p t="3284160" d="1980">Good, OK, so that's the answer.</p>
<p t="3286140" d="2560">In fact, you expect
to have just one boy.</p>
<p t="3288700" d="4159">And the proof, we sort
of just did it here.</p>
<p t="3292859" d="1791">Now, in this case,
we're going to set it up</p>
<p t="3294650" d="1810">as a mean time to failure.</p>
<p t="3296460" d="2020">Same kind of thing.</p>
<p t="3298480" d="3470">Now, in this case the failure
mode, they want the girl,</p>
<p t="3301950" d="3690">but that's when you stop,
so that's the failure mode.</p>
<p t="3305640" d="1570">And a working step
is you have a boy</p>
<p t="3307210" d="1650">and you keep having the
working steps until you have</p>
<p t="3308860" d="1710">failure mode and then you stop.</p>
<p t="3310570" d="2060">And in this case,
we're not counting</p>
<p t="3312630" d="980">the step when you stop.</p>
<p t="3313610" d="5660">So we know from that that
the expected value of R</p>
<p t="3319270" d="3350">is 1 over p, which
is going to be 1/2.</p>
<p t="3322620" d="3800">That's the number of
children you have.</p>
<p t="3326420" d="3750">And that equals the
mean time to failure.</p>
<p t="3330170" d="4080">Minus the girl.</p>
<p t="3334250" d="3560">Because you count the girl
as one of the children.</p>
<p t="3337810" d="2229">And that's going to be the
expected number of boys.</p>
<p t="3340039" d="1541">So number of children
you're expected</p>
<p t="3341580" d="2300">to have minus the girl.</p>
<p t="3343880" d="890">This is 1 over 1/2.</p>
<p t="3349115" d="4215">And that is 2 minus 1 equals 1.</p>
<p t="3353330" d="5440">So you expect to have one
boy before you get the girl.</p>
<p t="3358770" d="4160">Any questions on that?</p>
<p t="3362930" d="3250">OK, how about this?</p>
<p t="3366180" d="3660">Some couples want to have
at least one of each sex.</p>
<p t="3369840" d="3690">They want to have at least
one boy and one girl.</p>
<p t="3373530" d="2640">So they keep having children
until they get one of each</p>
<p t="3376170" d="2000">and then they stop.</p>
<p t="3378170" d="2040">How many children do
they expect to have?</p>
<p t="3385910" d="1670">Somebody said two.</p>
<p t="3387580" d="3240">That's a minimum number.</p>
<p t="3390820" d="3560">So it's not likely to
be the expected number.</p>
<p t="3394380" d="1200">Three.</p>
<p t="3395580" d="2150">Well, OK, who said three?</p>
<p t="3397730" d="1300">Why do you think three?</p>
<p t="3399030" d="3818">AUDIENCE: Because you have to
have at least the first two,</p>
<p t="3402848" d="2972">so it can be greater than one.</p>
<p t="3405820" d="2482">I mean, one probability
is greater than one child,</p>
<p t="3408302" d="2232">one probability is
greater than two children.</p>
<p t="3410534" d="4546">And after that it's halves
which add up to one.</p>
<p t="3415080" d="1250">PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's right.</p>
<p t="3416330" d="833">That's a good proof.</p>
<p t="3417163" d="837">Very good.</p>
<p t="3418000" d="850">That'll work.</p>
<p t="3418850" d="988">Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p t="3419838" d="1583">AUDIENCE: I have a
question about what</p>
<p t="3421421" d="962">you were doing before.</p>
<p t="3422383" d="3046">If you were to switch your
expectations for a girl</p>
<p t="3425429" d="2245">and boy, wouldn't it come
out to the same number</p>
<p t="3427674" d="2896">but wouldn't it kind
of contradict itself?</p>
<p t="3430570" d="2370">PROFESSOR: No, if you stopped
as soon as you had a boy,</p>
<p t="3432940" d="2840">you'd expect to have one
girl before you got a boy.</p>
<p t="3435780" d="1277">Totally symmetric.</p>
<p t="3437057" d="2083">In this case, we're stopping
when we get the girl,</p>
<p t="3439140" d="2420">so we expect to have one boy.</p>
<p t="3441560" d="2794">You might have none, you might
have one, you might have two.</p>
<p t="3444354" d="2416">and as he mentions, if you put
the probabilities in there,</p>
<p t="3446770" d="1230">they will work
out the right way,</p>
<p t="3448000" d="2291">but we just did it simpler
by the mean time to failure.</p>
<p t="3452840" d="2070">And in fact, there's
also another proof,</p>
<p t="3454910" d="2310">what you're doing.</p>
<p t="3457220" d="2310">Another way to think
about how many kids</p>
<p t="3459530" d="1870">you have to get one of each.</p>
<p t="3461400" d="2480">Well you have the first kid.</p>
<p t="3463880" d="3380">And now you have this
problem, because you</p>
<p t="3467260" d="1940">want one of the other sex.</p>
<p t="3469200" d="2780">And you keep on trying to
get one of the other sex</p>
<p t="3471980" d="3870">and you expect to
have two children</p>
<p t="3475850" d="1240">to get one of the other sex.</p>
<p t="3477090" d="1330">So you have one to start.</p>
<p t="3478420" d="1340">Whatever it is doesn't matter.</p>
<p t="3479760" d="1930">And now you expect
to have two more</p>
<p t="3481690" d="1590">until you hit the other sex.</p>
<p t="3483280" d="2690">So a total of three is the
expected number of children</p>
<p t="3485970" d="5015">to get one boy and
one girl, at least.</p>
<p t="3490985" d="2329">Any questions about expectation?</p>
<p t="3495980" d="6030">OK, let's do another example.</p>
<p t="3502010" d="4110">This comes up all the
time in experimental work.</p>
<p t="3506120" d="3420">Probably all of you are going to
have some example at some point</p>
<p t="3509540" d="3510">where you're going to
do a problem like this.</p>
<p t="3513050" d="3970">And most all the time,
people do it wrong.</p>
<p t="3517020" d="2500">So let's see an example.</p>
<p t="3519520" d="4870">Say that you want to measure the
latency of some communications</p>
<p t="3524390" d="2020">channel.</p>
<p t="3526410" d="3080">And you want to know
what's the average latency.</p>
<p t="3529490" d="3080">So you set up an experiment.</p>
<p t="3532570" d="1610">You send a package
to the channel,</p>
<p t="3534180" d="2560">you measure when it started,
when it got to the other end,</p>
<p t="3536740" d="4160">and you record the answer,
and then you do it 100 times</p>
<p t="3540900" d="2040">and you take the average.</p>
<p t="3542940" d="3330">And you say that's the expected
latency of the channel.</p>
<p t="3546270" d="4557">Very, very typical kind of thing
to do, and sometimes OK to do.</p>
<p t="3550827" d="1333">So you'd do something like this.</p>
<p t="3552160" d="3530">You pick a random
variable D, which</p>
<p t="3555690" d="7507">is going to denote the
delay of a packet going</p>
<p t="3563197" d="833">through the channel.</p>
<p t="3568560" d="2450">And there's, of course,
some underlying distribution</p>
<p t="3571010" d="4980">here, which we'll
denote by f of x.</p>
<p t="3575990" d="2510">And that's just the
probability that D equals x.</p>
<p t="3578500" d="2010">That's the probability
distribution function.</p>
<p t="3586450" d="2670">And as part of doing
your stuff, you</p>
<p t="3589120" d="2990">notice that if I
look at plot f here,</p>
<p t="3592110" d="6210">if I look at x on that
axis and f of x here,</p>
<p t="3598320" d="1725">it looks something like this.</p>
<p t="3602910" d="2190">The chance of
getting the observed</p>
<p t="3605100" d="4190">cases where I got a long delay
were small, low probability.</p>
<p t="3609290" d="2600">And almost all the time
I got a short delay.</p>
<p t="3611890" d="2650">So very typically you'll get
a curve that looks something</p>
<p t="3614540" d="2890">like that in terms
of the observations</p>
<p t="3617430" d="3170">of your experiment.</p>
<p t="3620600" d="5330">And say that you do your
experiment 100 times</p>
<p t="3625930" d="2780">and the average latency
was 10 milliseconds.</p>
<p t="3631887" d="1833">And sometimes you want
to be really careful,</p>
<p t="3633720" d="3430">so you do the whole thing
again, you do another 100 times.</p>
<p t="3637150" d="2040">And maybe it's nine
milliseconds the next time.</p>
<p t="3639190" d="2090">And that sort of
confirms your belief</p>
<p t="3641280" d="1970">that your first
experiment was valid</p>
<p t="3643250" d="2180">and that the expected
latency on this channel</p>
<p t="3645430" d="3080">is 10 milliseconds.</p>
<p t="3648510" d="2880">Sounds pretty good.</p>
<p t="3651390" d="2320">But it can be completely wrong.</p>
<p t="3653710" d="1680">And not just because
you're unlucky,</p>
<p t="3655390" d="2480">but because you're taking
a simple method like that.</p>
<p t="3657870" d="6530">And let me show you an
example where it is way off.</p>
<p t="3674310" d="2900">All right, say you
were just a little more</p>
<p t="3677210" d="2140">sophisticated about this.</p>
<p t="3679350" d="2660">And when you did
your observations,</p>
<p t="3682010" d="4920">you tried to figure out what
this curve really looks like.</p>
<p t="3686930" d="2160">And say that you,
looking at the data,</p>
<p t="3689090" d="4240">concluded that the probability
that you have a delay of more</p>
<p t="3693330" d="4280">than i milliseconds is 1 and i.</p>
<p t="3697610" d="3870">That looks like this curve,
as close as anything.</p>
<p t="3701480" d="3754">So from your data,
you conclude this.</p>
<p t="3705234" d="1916">That's a little more
sophisticated conclusion,</p>
<p t="3707150" d="2150">because now you've
identified what</p>
<p t="3709300" d="2260">you believe the
distribution is, which</p>
<p t="3711560" d="3440">is stronger than expectation.</p>
<p t="3715000" d="3754">How would you go about
figuring out the expected value</p>
<p t="3718754" d="1166">if you had that information?</p>
<p t="3723800" d="2580">I mean, you could average
the 100 sample points.</p>
<p t="3726380" d="4170">But is there any way, if you
assume this, what would you</p>
<p t="3730550" d="4130">do for the expected value?</p>
<p t="3734680" d="1820">Yeah, did I erase the theorem?</p>
<p t="3736500" d="2370">No, it's over there.</p>
<p t="3738870" d="3320">We just plug it to the theorem.</p>
<p t="3742190" d="1400">The expected delay
is going to be</p>
<p t="3743590" d="6210">the sum of those probabilities
from 1 to infinity.</p>
<p t="3749800" d="2960">So we would compute
from the theorem</p>
<p t="3752760" d="6866">the expected delay is i equals
1 to infinity probability.</p>
<p t="3763090" d="1714">Do I want to do the 0 case?</p>
<p t="3764804" d="2166">Want to be sure I don't get
caught up in the 0 case.</p>
<p t="3766970" d="1590">We'll use the case
1 to infinity.</p>
<p t="3768560" d="2510">Probability D greater
than or equal to i.</p>
<p t="3771070" d="1890">So let me put greater
than or equal to here.</p>
<p t="3776740" d="5480">That equals the sum i equals
1 to infinity of 1 over i.</p>
<p t="3782220" d="1000">What's that?</p>
<p t="3787220" d="4410">What's the sum of 1 over
i, i from 1 to infinity?</p>
<p t="3791630" d="1660">It's infinite.</p>
<p t="3793290" d="2540">Remember those harmonic number?</p>
<p t="3795830" d="3290">i going from 1 to n
gives you about log n.</p>
<p t="3799120" d="3170">Remember that, the
book stacking thing?</p>
<p t="3802290" d="6330">i going from 1 to
infinity, that's infinity.</p>
<p t="3808620" d="4450">So in fact, your expected
latency is infinite.</p>
<p t="3813070" d="2650">And you just published a paper
saying it was 10 milliseconds,</p>
<p t="3815720" d="730">maybe nine.</p>
<p t="3821020" d="2440">So it's very dangerous to just
take a bunch of the points,</p>
<p t="3823460" d="4444">add them up, and average them
and say that is the answer.</p>
<p t="3827904" d="1416">Especially if you
have some reason</p>
<p t="3829320" d="1810">to believe the distribution
looks like this</p>
<p t="3831130" d="1541">and it really is
something like that.</p>
<p t="3832671" d="2173">It could be infinite.</p>
<p t="3834844" d="2166">Now in some cases, if your
distribution is very well</p>
<p t="3837010" d="1960">behaved, averaging
your sample points</p>
<p t="3838970" d="2350">is the perfect thing to do.</p>
<p t="3841320" d="3863">But it helps to know it's not
necessarily the case that's</p>
<p t="3845183" d="907">a good way to go.</p>
<p t="3849000" d="1518">Any ideas what went wrong?</p>
<p t="3850518" d="500">Yeah.</p>
<p t="3851018" d="1166">AUDIENCE: I have a question.</p>
<p t="3852184" d="2106">What would be your
probability be over i squared?</p>
<p t="3854290" d="1666">PROFESSOR: Yeah, what
would happen then?</p>
<p t="3855956" d="3744">If in fact, it was
1 over i squared.</p>
<p t="3863840" d="2617">So you need to do this sum.</p>
<p t="3866457" d="1833">Here's a good review
question for the final.</p>
<p t="3868290" d="1820">What method do you
use to estimate that?</p>
<p t="3872770" d="2590">Remember the how do we do that?</p>
<p t="3875360" d="2180">Is that infinite?</p>
<p t="3877540" d="1040">No.</p>
<p t="3878580" d="2670">He used the integration bound.</p>
<p t="3881250" d="3822">And you'll see what
this is pretty small.</p>
<p t="3885072" d="1708">It'll be, what, 1 and
a 1/2, 2, something</p>
<p t="3886780" d="2880">like that where we can do
the integration method here.</p>
<p t="3889660" d="2230">So huge difference.</p>
<p t="3891890" d="850">This is O of 1.</p>
<p t="3892740" d="1450">This is bounded.</p>
<p t="3894190" d="4570">Probably less than 2, if we
did the integration method.</p>
<p t="3898760" d="3890">So huge difference here
in what the outcome is.</p>
<p t="3902650" d="4470">Now, how can it be
that I've got something</p>
<p t="3907120" d="5030">with expected infinite value
and I average 100 points</p>
<p t="3912150" d="2030">and I got 10 milliseconds?</p>
<p t="3914180" d="1950">Yeah.</p>
<p t="3916130" d="2000">AUDIENCE: The infinite
value comes from the fact</p>
<p t="3918130" d="2843">that there is a
decent probability</p>
<p t="3920973" d="2255">that delay is going to be huge.</p>
<p t="3923228" d="3078">However, if you only take a
finite number of sample points,</p>
<p t="3926306" d="2522">then chances are
you're not going</p>
<p t="3928828" d="1962">to get any monstrous delays.</p>
<p t="3930790" d="1220">PROFESSOR: Exactly.</p>
<p t="3932010" d="2660">The chance of seeing anything
beyond 100 milliseconds</p>
<p t="3934670" d="3216">is 1 in 100.</p>
<p t="3937886" d="1374">So I'm probably
not going to see.</p>
<p t="3939260" d="2270">In a sample size of
100, almost surely</p>
<p t="3941530" d="5020">I won't see something that takes
a second, 1,000 milliseconds.</p>
<p t="3946550" d="2920">But yet it's those
rare sample points</p>
<p t="3949470" d="3150">that are causing
that sum to blow up.</p>
<p t="3952620" d="3530">If I sum that from 1 to
100, I get log of 10.</p>
<p t="3956150" d="592">Pretty small.</p>
<p t="3959300" d="4782">So I get log of 100,
which is pretty small.</p>
<p t="3964082" d="2208">So what's happening when
you do your finite sample is</p>
<p t="3966290" d="2660">you're missing
the big guys which</p>
<p t="3968950" d="3180">are very rare, but enough
to blow up your expectation.</p>
<p t="3972130" d="2890">Now, you can draw two
conclusions from that.</p>
<p t="3975020" d="1230">One of them is just we did.</p>
<p t="3976250" d="1390">The other is,
well, expectation's</p>
<p t="3977640" d="894">the wrong measure.</p>
<p t="3978534" d="1416">And really what
we should be doing</p>
<p t="3979950" d="3989">is looking at only 1,000 sample
points or something like that.</p>
<p t="3983939" d="2291">But in practice of using the
thing over and over again,</p>
<p t="3986230" d="2250">eventually you're going
to get hit with a whopper.</p>
<p t="3988480" d="2150">Sometimes you'll see
people take data points out</p>
<p t="3990630" d="2100">when they're really
the big ones.</p>
<p t="3992730" d="1790">They say, oh, well,
that was an anomaly.</p>
<p t="3994520" d="2773">I take that out and then
we compute the average.</p>
<p t="3997293" d="499">Yeah?</p>
<p t="3997792" d="1666">AUDIENCE: How much
would you pay to play</p>
<p t="3999458" d="3657">a game where the pair would the
be the latency of the packet?</p>
<p t="4003115" d="958">PROFESSOR: What's that?</p>
<p t="4004073" d="1541">AUDIENCE: How much
do you pay to play</p>
<p t="4005614" d="2466">a game where the pair would
be the latency of the packet?</p>
<p t="4008080" d="875">PROFESSOR: All right.</p>
<p t="4011720" d="2090">That's a big number.</p>
<p t="4013810" d="3360">If that was my losses
here, that's tough.</p>
<p t="4017170" d="3330">I'd bet anything
up against that.</p>
<p t="4020500" d="2230">To get a payoff of infinity?</p>
<p t="4022730" d="2530">You'd pay $1,000
to play that game.</p>
<p t="4025260" d="2780">Now, you'd want to
play it for a long time</p>
<p t="4028040" d="3010">to get that big payoff, right?</p>
<p t="4031050" d="2370">But eventually that's
what it's going to be.</p>
<p t="4039260" d="600">Any questions?</p>
<p t="4039860" d="3180">People understand the
issue here and what</p>
<p t="4043040" d="2610">to worry about when you
all do that someday?</p>
<p t="4045650" d="584">Yeah.</p>
<p t="4046234" d="916">AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p t="4053350" d="2750">PROFESSOR: Yeah, now here
you don't know for a fact</p>
<p t="4056100" d="500">this is it.</p>
<p t="4056600" d="2040">But you could model and
you start seeing these.</p>
<p t="4058640" d="3520">You fill in the points and
you say, it looks like this,</p>
<p t="4062160" d="3144">let's assume that's what it
was, then here's the result.</p>
<p t="4065304" d="2166">If it looks like it's 1
over i squared, you can say,</p>
<p t="4067470" d="2230">let's assume that's what
it is and then you get</p>
<p t="4069700" d="3350">a different result. But
you take the various cases</p>
<p t="4073050" d="2160">and consider them to do it.</p>
<p t="4075210" d="3990">Or you could say, I take the
expectation assuming I never</p>
<p t="4079200" d="3070">get a point bigger than 100.</p>
<p t="4082270" d="1270">And I limit it that way.</p>
<p t="4083540" d="1702">And then you're
safe at that point</p>
<p t="4085242" d="1208">and you can get away with it.</p>
<p t="4086450" d="1791">But to blindly go out
there and say here it</p>
<p t="4088241" d="1872">is, not so reliable.</p>
<p t="4096359" d="4051">The expected value does have
a lot of useful properties.</p>
<p t="4100410" d="5100">And the most important is
called linearity of expectation.</p>
<p t="4105510" d="2353">And we'll spend the rest of
today and some of next time</p>
<p t="4107863" d="708">talking about it.</p>
<p t="4112229" d="2681">And quite possibly it's
one of the reasons people</p>
<p t="4114910" d="2989">use it so much instead of other
things you might think about.</p>
<p t="4133020" d="2299">The theorem, and this may be
the most important theorem</p>
<p t="4135319" d="654">on probability.</p>
<p t="4138810" d="14610">For any random variables, R1 and
R2, on a probability space S,</p>
<p t="4153420" d="8470">the expected value of R1 plus R2
equals the expected value of R1</p>
<p t="4161890" d="4400">plus the expected value of R2.</p>
<p t="4166290" d="1257">Very simple.</p>
<p t="4167547" d="1583">It's another way of
saying expectation</p>
<p t="4169130" d="2950">is a linear function.</p>
<p t="4172080" d="499">The proof.</p>
<p t="4177109" d="1221">No, skip the proof here.</p>
<p t="4178330" d="1651">It's not hard and
it's in the text.</p>
<p t="4183760" d="2104">Follows pretty simply
from the definition.</p>
<p t="4193250" d="3817">There's a generalization for
more than two random variables.</p>
<p t="4199810" d="1187">So corollary.</p>
<p t="4203990" d="8400">For all k in the natural numbers
and k random variables R1,</p>
<p t="4212390" d="6530">R2, up to Rk on the
sample probability space</p>
<p t="4218920" d="9170">S. The expected value of
R1 plus R2 plus Rk is just</p>
<p t="4228090" d="1375">the sum of the expected values.</p>
<p t="4236220" d="3992">And the proof of that is by
induction using that result.</p>
<p t="4240212" d="1708">And the really important
thing about this</p>
<p t="4241920" d="2510">is that neither of these
results needs independence.</p>
<p t="4247370" d="5394">It is true whether or not
the Ri are independent.</p>
<p t="4258850" d="2340">Pretty much everything
we do in probability</p>
<p t="4261190" d="3340">to manipulate random variables
needs them to be independent.</p>
<p t="4264530" d="1520">You don't need that here.</p>
<p t="4266050" d="2362">And that'll make
it very powerful.</p>
<p t="4268412" d="958">So let's do an example.</p>
<p t="4288370" d="4076">Say I roll two fair dice.</p>
<p t="4295780" d="940">Six sided dice.</p>
<p t="4302320" d="3040">Not necessarily independent.</p>
<p t="4305360" d="3370">R1 is the outcome
on the first die.</p>
<p t="4313990" d="6750">And R2 will be the
outcome on the second one.</p>
<p t="4320740" d="3940">And I'm interested in
the sum of the dice.</p>
<p t="4324680" d="3790">So with that R
it'd be R1 plus R2.</p>
<p t="4328470" d="3592">And I want to know the expected
value of the sum of the dice</p>
<p t="4332062" d="708">when I roll them.</p>
<p t="4336280" d="3980">Now, if I didn't
use that theorem</p>
<p t="4340260" d="2480">I'd compute the tree
in the sample space.</p>
<p t="4342740" d="4620">I'd get 36 possible outcomes,
take the probability of each.</p>
<p t="4347360" d="1850">It'd take you a
little while to do it,</p>
<p t="4349210" d="4110">but using linearity of
expectation, it's easy.</p>
<p t="4353320" d="4750">It's expected value of R1
plus the expected value of R2.</p>
<p t="4358070" d="5160">Each of these we already
figured out is 3 and 1/2.</p>
<p t="4363230" d="3100">And so the answer is 7.</p>
<p t="4366330" d="2840">So if you roll a pair
of dice, whether or not</p>
<p t="4369170" d="3551">they are independent, the
expected sum is seven.</p>
<p t="4375370" d="3900">Any questions about
linearity of expectation?</p>
<p t="4379270" d="852">Yeah.</p>
<p t="4380122" d="916">AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p t="4388750" d="1800">PROFESSOR: This one?</p>
<p t="4390550" d="784">[INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p t="4391334" d="916">AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p t="4394950" d="1580">PROFESSOR: No, I
mean pluses here.</p>
<p t="4396530" d="1700">Here?</p>
<p t="4398230" d="2183">I'm computing the sum
of the random variables.</p>
<p t="4403180" d="4000">So this could be a 1, that could
be a 10, this could be a 3.</p>
<p t="4407180" d="2430">So I'm compute the
expected value of the sum,</p>
<p t="4409610" d="2160">just like when I
rolled two, dice I'm</p>
<p t="4411770" d="4558">taking the expected value
of the sum of the dice.</p>
<p t="4416328" d="833">Any other questions?</p>
<p t="4423850" d="3760">Now we're going to do a
little trickier problem that</p>
<p t="4427610" d="1952">uses linearity of expectation.</p>
<p t="4433250" d="1720">Yeah?</p>
<p t="4434970" d="2970">AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
sets, like when</p>
<p t="4437940" d="3905">we're looking at the failure.</p>
<p t="4441845" d="4363">Couldn't we add the two
cases, like R1 being</p>
<p t="4446208" d="2442">a girl and R2 being a boy?</p>
<p t="4448650" d="6274">PROFESSOR: Well, what
would it mean to sum-- so</p>
<p t="4454924" d="1166">what is the random variable?</p>
<p t="4456090" d="1730">R1 is the case
when you get a boy.</p>
<p t="4457820" d="2120">So it's an indicator
for getting a boy.</p>
<p t="4459940" d="2850">R2 is the indicator
for getting a girl.</p>
<p t="4462790" d="2520">R1 plus R2 is by
definition 1 then,</p>
<p t="4465310" d="1450">because you got a boy or a girl.</p>
<p t="4466760" d="1570">One of them had to happen.</p>
<p t="4468330" d="1590">And the expected
value would be one,</p>
<p t="4469920" d="2770">But that's a different
kind of game.</p>
<p t="4472690" d="3750">But we are going to start using
this in sophisticated ways</p>
<p t="4476440" d="2865">to make calculations be
easier for things like that.</p>
<p t="4483680" d="500">so</p>
<p t="4484180" d="2050">This problem we call
the hat check problem.</p>
<p t="4491560" d="2690">And the idea here
behind this is say</p>
<p t="4494250" d="5100">that you have n men at a
restaurant having dinner.</p>
<p t="4499350" d="1760">And when they come
into the restaurant,</p>
<p t="4501110" d="3250">they check their hats
in the coat room.</p>
<p t="4504360" d="2430">Then something goes
wrong in the coat room</p>
<p t="4506790" d="3410">and the hats are all
scrambled up randomly.</p>
<p t="4510200" d="2810">Let's say a random
permutation of the hats.</p>
<p t="4513010" d="2470">So the men come back
to get their hats</p>
<p t="4515480" d="3890">and they get a random
hat coming back.</p>
<p t="4519370" d="11850">So each man gets a random
hat back after dinner.</p>
<p t="4531220" d="4300">And the question is, what is
the expected number of men</p>
<p t="4535520" d="1811">to get the right hat back?</p>
<p t="4539980" d="1860">So we let R be the
random variable</p>
<p t="4541840" d="3750">that says the
number of men to get</p>
<p t="4545590" d="3572">the right hat, their happen.</p>
<p t="4552000" d="5140">And we want to know the
expected value of R.</p>
<p t="4557140" d="1710">Now, from the
definition, that's just</p>
<p t="4558850" d="2720">the sum of all possibilities.</p>
<p t="4561570" d="2986">K from 1 to n.</p>
<p t="4564556" d="4544">K times the
probability R equals k.</p>
<p t="4569100" d="3230">So using one of
the definitions, we</p>
<p t="4572330" d="1980">could compute the
expected value this way.</p>
<p t="4574310" d="3510">In fact, if you were to
be assigned this on a test</p>
<p t="4577820" d="1950">or on homework, that's
probably how you'd</p>
<p t="4579770" d="1240">start something like that.</p>
<p t="4583560" d="2434">And then, well, the
next step you'd take</p>
<p t="4585994" d="2416">would be to figure out what's
the probability that exactly</p>
<p t="4588410" d="4570">K men get the right hat back.</p>
<p t="4592980" d="2300">In fact, we actually
asked this once before we</p>
<p t="4595280" d="2150">started doing it in class.</p>
<p t="4597430" d="2740">And it was really hard if
you went down this path.</p>
<p t="4600170" d="4060">Because if you spent all
night with your buddies,</p>
<p t="4604230" d="2550">you would maybe get
to the conclusion</p>
<p t="4606780" d="5550">that probability R
equals K is this.</p>
<p t="4612330" d="7470">1 over K factorial times n minus
K down here for K less than</p>
<p t="4619800" d="2880">or equal to n minus 2.</p>
<p t="4622680" d="7450">And 1 over n factorial if
K equals n minus 1 or n.</p>
<p t="4630130" d="4460">Then you would plug that nasty
looking thing into there.</p>
<p t="4634590" d="3740">So multiply by K. And
you'd have to sum it up.</p>
<p t="4638330" d="1450">And Lord help you.</p>
<p t="4639780" d="2220">That's just a nightmare to do.</p>
<p t="4642000" d="2640">You'd have a very hard
time getting the answer.</p>
<p t="4644640" d="3340">If you doubt that, try it.</p>
<p t="4647980" d="1984">But that would be a
natural way to proceed.</p>
<p t="4652790" d="2640">But it turns out there is a
trivial way to get the answer.</p>
<p t="4655430" d="2510">And this is a very
powerful technique</p>
<p t="4657940" d="2260">using linearity of expectation.</p>
<p t="4660200" d="3390">And for sure there will be a
problem on the final exam just</p>
<p t="4663590" d="2200">like this.</p>
<p t="4665790" d="3830">And so if you go down this path,
which is a natural first path,</p>
<p t="4669620" d="4010">it may take you the rest
of the day to solve it.</p>
<p t="4673630" d="1500">But the method I'm
going to show you</p>
<p t="4675130" d="2277">will take you a couple
minutes to do it.</p>
<p t="4682370" d="2700">Now, the trick is to use
linearity of expectations.</p>
<p t="4685070" d="4540">So the problem is
there's no sum here.</p>
<p t="4689610" d="2350">So what we need to do is
we're going to express R</p>
<p t="4691960" d="4340">as the sum of random variables.</p>
<p t="4696300" d="6440">And the way we're going
to do that is as follows.</p>
<p t="4702740" d="1800">And it's not obvious,
but once you see it,</p>
<p t="4704540" d="1554">it's easy to keep using it.</p>
<p t="4708700" d="7125">We let R be the sum
of R1 plus R2 plus Rn.</p>
<p t="4715825" d="4250">And Ri is going to
tell us the event.</p>
<p t="4720075" d="2495">This is sort of what
you were talking</p>
<p t="4722570" d="2600">about before with the event
of a boy or event of a girl.</p>
<p t="4725170" d="2410">This is going to be the
event of the ith man</p>
<p t="4727580" d="3250">gets his right hat back.</p>
<p t="4730830" d="1880">So it's an indicator
random variable.</p>
<p t="4732710" d="6900">It's 1 if the ith man
gets the right hat.</p>
<p t="4742170" d="1940">And it's 0 if he doesn't.</p>
<p t="4750060" d="4640">So whenever the ith guy gets his
hat back, that counts as one,</p>
<p t="4754700" d="2395">and now you can see
why this sum works.</p>
<p t="4757095" d="4015">R is the number of men to
get the right hat back.</p>
<p t="4761110" d="3100">And it basically there's a
one counted in here every time</p>
<p t="4764210" d="4530">a guy gets his hat back,
and 0 if he doesn't.</p>
<p t="4768740" d="4536">So this sum is counting how many
men got their right hat back.</p>
<p t="4776280" d="2700">Non-obvious the first
time, gets really simple</p>
<p t="4778980" d="2440">the fourth or fifth time.</p>
<p t="4781420" d="2476">We'll try to do a
couple of them today.</p>
<p t="4788290" d="4215">All right, now the expected
value of R is easy.</p>
<p t="4795230" d="2040">It's just by linearity
of expectation,</p>
<p t="4797270" d="3320">expected value of
R1 and so forth</p>
<p t="4800590" d="1300">plus the expected value of Rn.</p>
<p t="4805310" d="4840">The expected value of an
indicator random variable</p>
<p t="4810150" d="3200">is just the probability
that it's 1.</p>
<p t="4813350" d="1690">Right it's 1 times
the probability,</p>
<p t="4815040" d="2444">it's 0 times the
probability of 0.</p>
<p t="4817484" d="1666">That's just the
probability that it's 1.</p>
<p t="4828650" d="3030">What's the probability that the
first man gets the right hat</p>
<p t="4831680" d="2720">back?</p>
<p t="4834400" d="680">1 over n.</p>
<p t="4835080" d="650">There's n hats.</p>
<p t="4835730" d="3090">He gets a random one.</p>
<p t="4838820" d="2787">What's the probability that the
second man gets his hat back?</p>
<p t="4844870" d="3110">Not 1 over n minus 1.</p>
<p t="4847980" d="2780">He's coming in whether he's
first, second, or last.</p>
<p t="4850760" d="2870">He gets a random hat.</p>
<p t="4853630" d="1680">1 in n chance it's his.</p>
<p t="4859340" d="5320">What's the probability the last
man gets the right hat back?</p>
<p t="4864660" d="540">One over n.</p>
<p t="4865200" d="1833">Doesn't really matter
if he's first or last.</p>
<p t="4867033" d="1997">Just sort of tricks
up a little bit.</p>
<p t="4869030" d="2450">He's getting a random hat back.</p>
<p t="4871480" d="990">So it's 1 over n.</p>
<p t="4875330" d="2550">I got n of each, 1
over n, so what's</p>
<p t="4877880" d="3290">the expected number of men
to get the right hat back?</p>
<p t="4881170" d="2120">One.</p>
<p t="4883290" d="3390">Now, the math doesn't get
much easier than that.</p>
<p t="4886680" d="2800">Now, the amazing
thing is we just</p>
<p t="4889480" d="5250">proved that if we take
that mess, stick it in here</p>
<p t="4894730" d="3880">and sum it up, what
answer do we get?</p>
<p t="4898610" d="1290">1.</p>
<p t="4899900" d="2410">That is certainly not obvious,
but that is a consequence</p>
<p t="4902310" d="1930">of everything we've just done.</p>
<p t="4904240" d="3320">We've just given a probability
proof of that fact.</p>
<p t="4907560" d="2610">But the nice thing here
is there's actually</p>
<p t="4910170" d="2750">even more powerful.</p>
<p t="4912920" d="3950">Did I need to assume that it
was a random permutation of hats</p>
<p t="4916870" d="1730">like I would need
to assume for this?</p>
<p t="4923180" d="2860">No independence is needed.</p>
<p t="4926040" d="3310">In fact, there's all sorts
of distributions that will</p>
<p t="4929350" d="1790">give the same expected value.</p>
<p t="4931140" d="3080">All I need is that each
person gets the right hat back</p>
<p t="4934220" d="3026">with probability 1 over n.</p>
<p t="4937246" d="2714">In fact, this is an example
of a different distribution</p>
<p t="4939960" d="2430">for which the
result is the same.</p>
<p t="4942390" d="2069">Say you're at a
Chinese restaurant.</p>
<p t="4944459" d="1791">And you know they have
the thing that spins</p>
<p t="4946250" d="2390">in the middle of the table?</p>
<p t="4948640" d="1740">Say that you each
order an appetizer.</p>
<p t="4950380" d="2470">There's n people and they're
around a big circular table.</p>
<p t="4952850" d="2260">Everybody gets their appetizer.</p>
<p t="4955110" d="1820">Wonton soup, whatever.</p>
<p t="4956930" d="3610">And then there's always the
joker who spins the thing</p>
<p t="4960540" d="4020">and spins around
and then it stops</p>
<p t="4964560" d="3920">and now you've got a random
appetizer in front of you.</p>
<p t="4968480" d="2450">In this case, we
want to know what's</p>
<p t="4970930" d="2990">the expected number of people
to get the right appetizer back.</p>
<p t="4973920" d="4540">Not the other guys
wonton soup, but yours.</p>
<p t="4978460" d="1660">That's a different
probability space</p>
<p t="4980120" d="2242">because there's only n
sample points, n places where</p>
<p t="4982362" d="1208">the thing could have stopped.</p>
<p t="4983570" d="4820">Not n factorial like the hats.</p>
<p t="4988390" d="4280">Well, does the analysis change?</p>
<p t="4992670" d="1990">Exactly the same.</p>
<p t="4994660" d="2660">Ri is the indicator
variable for the ith person</p>
<p t="4997320" d="2880">gets the right appetizer back.</p>
<p t="5000200" d="2450">Linearity of expectation.</p>
<p t="5002650" d="1930">The expected value of
the indicator variable</p>
<p t="5004580" d="2170">is just the probability
that it's 1.</p>
<p t="5006750" d="1460">And the probability
that any person</p>
<p t="5008210" d="2800">gets the right
appetizer is 1 over n.</p>
<p t="5011010" d="1140">So the answer is the same.</p>
<p t="5012150" d="2333">The expected number of people
to get the right appetizer</p>
<p t="5014483" d="1917">back is 1.</p>
<p t="5016400" d="3730">So totally different
probability spaces, exactly</p>
<p t="5020130" d="3710">the same analysis and answer.</p>
<p t="5023840" d="3420">OK, so we'll do more
of this next time.</p>
