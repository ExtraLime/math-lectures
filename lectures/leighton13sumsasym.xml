<p t="22790" d="3330">PROFESSOR: OK,
let's get started.</p>
<p t="26120" d="4440">Last time we looked at a
variety of ways to analyze sums</p>
<p t="30560" d="3340">and to find closed-form
expressions for the sums.</p>
<p t="33900" d="3540">And today we're going to
use those methods to solve</p>
<p t="37440" d="4480">a variety of famous problems,
one of them involving center</p>
<p t="41920" d="2450">of mass and stacking blocks.</p>
<p t="44370" d="2440">We saw a version
of that yesterday</p>
<p t="46810" d="3190">in recitation, where you solved
the problem of figuring out</p>
<p t="50000" d="5150">how many L's you need to make
something like this balance</p>
<p t="55150" d="1720">perfectly.</p>
<p t="56870" d="3380">Now in this case I didn't
actually get an integer number</p>
<p t="60250" d="2500">of L's-- which is possible--
because I didn't quite get it</p>
<p t="62750" d="1480">stacked right at the bottom.</p>
<p t="64230" d="1920">So I got 10 and 1/2 L's here.</p>
<p t="66150" d="2510">There's an extra vertical here.</p>
<p t="68660" d="4330">Now in theory there are two
integer ways of doing it.</p>
<p t="72990" d="2440">And you proved that
yesterday in recitation.</p>
<p t="75430" d="2630">So in theory, 10
and 11 should work,</p>
<p t="78060" d="2110">but in practice the
blocks aren't perfect.</p>
<p t="80170" d="1830">I didn't get them
perfectly lined up.</p>
<p t="82000" d="2640">And so 10 wouldn't quite
work, and 11 tended</p>
<p t="84640" d="1890">to pitch it the other way.</p>
<p t="86530" d="3360">And of course in theory, as
long as the center of mass</p>
<p t="89890" d="4190">is just anywhere over this
block, it's going to be stable.</p>
<p t="94080" d="3470">In practice there's air moving
around, and bouncing and stuff.</p>
<p t="97550" d="3350">And so if you're close to
the edge, it's going over.</p>
<p t="100900" d="520">OK.</p>
<p t="101420" d="2083">So now if you want to build
one of these yourself,</p>
<p t="103503" d="2607">it's not hard to do.</p>
<p t="106110" d="2754">You just start with an
extra block here, all right,</p>
<p t="108864" d="916">and then you build up.</p>
<p t="109780" d="666">And that's easy.</p>
<p t="110446" d="2466">And then you notice
when it's about right.</p>
<p t="112912" d="1958">And you can just start
wiggling this block out.</p>
<p t="114870" d="2980">And then it looks pretty
cool at that point.</p>
<p t="117850" d="3207">Actually it was a student
in the class showed me this</p>
<p t="121057" d="2333">a couple of years ago, because
we were doing the blocks.</p>
<p t="123390" d="1390">The next thing we're going
to do-- we were doing that--</p>
<p t="124780" d="1541">and he said, hey,
there's this thing.</p>
<p t="126321" d="1829">And yeah, pretty cool.</p>
<p t="128150" d="2889">So today we're going to
look at a different problem,</p>
<p t="131039" d="4111">and that's the problem of
getting the blocks stacked up</p>
<p t="135150" d="4800">so they go out over the edge of
the table-- if that's doable.</p>
<p t="139950" d="10890">So the goal is to stack
the blocks up like this.</p>
<p t="150840" d="2080">We go farther and farther out.</p>
<p t="152920" d="2490">And the question
we're going to look at</p>
<p t="155410" d="4000">is is it possible-- whoa.</p>
<p t="159410" d="500">Almost.</p>
<p t="159910" d="3999">Is it possible to get a block
all the way off the table?</p>
<p t="163909" d="1791">That's the question
we're going to look at.</p>
<p t="165700" d="1740">And here I got close.</p>
<p t="167440" d="2775">And you can see it's
getting a little tipsy.</p>
<p t="170215" d="875">It's not going to go.</p>
<p t="171090" d="2360">It's going to fall over.</p>
<p t="173450" d="2580">So I didn't do it this time.</p>
<p t="176030" d="3330">You're only allowed
one block per level.</p>
<p t="179360" d="4750">So you can't do
anything like this.</p>
<p t="184110" d="1480">That's not allowed.</p>
<p t="185590" d="5090">You can go backwards,
if that helps you.</p>
<p t="190680" d="2890">Well it's got to be
stable on both sides.</p>
<p t="193570" d="2650">But you can go back and forth.</p>
<p t="196220" d="3150">So the question is, can you
get out one block totally</p>
<p t="199370" d="1990">out over the table?</p>
<p t="201360" d="3800">How many people think
it can't be done?</p>
<p t="205160" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="205660" d="1150">A few doubters.</p>
<p t="206810" d="1020">More doubters.</p>
<p t="207830" d="2350">How many think it can be done?</p>
<p t="210180" d="1750">Oh, a lot of people
think it can be done.</p>
<p t="211930" d="820">OK.</p>
<p t="212750" d="2550">Well all right.</p>
<p t="215300" d="3240">How many people think
you can get a block</p>
<p t="218540" d="3540">two blocks out over the table?</p>
<p t="222080" d="1860">A few of you.</p>
<p t="223940" d="4290">How many think you can
get it three blocks out?</p>
<p t="228230" d="790">You're believers.</p>
<p t="229020" d="1410">OK.</p>
<p t="230430" d="3410">How many people think
I can reach that wall?</p>
<p t="233840" d="2700">Well I got to tell you I
can't reach the wall because--</p>
<p t="236540" d="1583">AUDIENCE: The ceiling
gets in the way.</p>
<p t="238123" d="897">PROFESSOR: Yeah.</p>
<p t="239020" d="1880">That's going to be hard to do.</p>
<p t="240900" d="2660">But this is what we're
going to try to figure out.</p>
<p t="243560" d="2720">And we're going to do it
with a little competition.</p>
<p t="246280" d="5770">So we're going to have a team
of you go up against the TAs.</p>
<p t="252050" d="5029">And the winner gets
candy to share.</p>
<p t="257079" d="4440">The losing team gets the
infamous 6042 Nerd Pride pocket</p>
<p t="261519" d="1511">protectors.</p>
<p t="263030" d="910">Very nice.</p>
<p t="263940" d="1050">Shiny plastic.</p>
<p t="264990" d="2110">Has the MIT logo on them.</p>
<p t="267100" d="1210">Very handy.</p>
<p t="268310" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="268810" d="2920">So I need four volunteers.</p>
<p t="271730" d="1980">So come on down if
you'd like to volunteer.</p>
<p t="273710" d="1690">You can win some
candy for the class--</p>
<p t="275400" d="3410">or at least win yourself
a pocket protector.</p>
<p t="278810" d="3210">And we'll put the
class over there.</p>
<p t="282020" d="3590">And we get the TAs to come down.</p>
<p t="285610" d="850">So come on down.</p>
<p t="286460" d="1041">I got a couple of people.</p>
<p t="287501" d="1419">Who else wants to join them?</p>
<p t="288920" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="289420" d="1490">Come on down.</p>
<p t="290910" d="3397">We've got a fourth
volunteer out there?</p>
<p t="297271" d="499">All right.</p>
<p t="297770" d="1291">We got some people coming down.</p>
<p t="299061" d="1369">All right, come on over.</p>
<p t="300430" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="300930" d="1340">You got all the blocks you want.</p>
<p t="302270" d="2390">We could even take
this thing down.</p>
<p t="304660" d="4000">So here's your supply.</p>
<p t="308660" d="830">All right.</p>
<p t="309490" d="2320">Now the TAs have a little
bit of an advantage,</p>
<p t="311810" d="4150">because they've done this
before, some of them.</p>
<p t="315960" d="3110">So you can give some advice
to your colleagues here.</p>
<p t="319070" d="2390">So you got to get some blocks
out of the block supply.</p>
<p t="321460" d="1291">Maybe we should take this down.</p>
<p t="322751" d="2429">It's about to fall over anyway.</p>
<p t="325180" d="2370">So yeah, how do
we get this down?</p>
<p t="327550" d="3026">I'm not sure.</p>
<p t="330576" d="1194">All right, I got this end.</p>
<p t="334476" d="904">Whoa!</p>
<p t="335380" d="560">There we go.</p>
<p t="335940" d="1000">Whoa!</p>

<p t="337940" d="1000">Oops!</p>
<p t="338940" d="2943">All right.</p>
<p t="341883" d="500">There we go.</p>
<p t="350020" d="3850">So whoever gets a block
out over the farthest wins.</p>
<p t="353870" d="1370">One block per level.</p>
<p t="355240" d="2385">You can't do two
blocks on a level.</p>
<p t="357625" d="1625">Believe me it's a
lot easier if you can</p>
<p t="359250" d="1420">do multiple blocks per level.</p>
<p t="365080" d="1510">You can go back and forth.</p>
<p t="366590" d="2090">Go ahead and give
them some advice.</p>
<p t="368680" d="2600">They look like they need it.</p>
<p t="371280" d="2105">They're only about half
a block out so far.</p>

forward, two steps back?</p>

<p t="385780" d="1500">This is an interesting
idea I think</p>
<p t="387280" d="3276">is to go out as far as possible
and then just weight it back.</p>
<p t="390556" d="2302">Does that change anything?</p>
<p t="392858" d="2237">Like this you're saying?</p>

how many people</p>
<p t="652460" d="3560">still think we can get it
all the way to the wall?</p>
<p t="656020" d="840">Ah, a few people.</p>
<p t="656860" d="2970">In fact, if you stack
this high enough--</p>
<p t="659830" d="2420">and we're going to analyze
how high it has to go--</p>
<p t="662250" d="1620">you could reach the wall.</p>
<p t="663870" d="2120">Now in fact we're going
to find that you probably</p>
<p t="665990" d="3020">got to go out to the
stars to get that high</p>
<p t="669010" d="1480">before you can reach the wall.</p>
<p t="670490" d="3260">So it's not too practical.</p>
<p t="673750" d="4380">Now what I want to do is
analyze this strategy.</p>
<p t="678130" d="1750">And this sort of looks
like a nice design.</p>
<p t="679880" d="1920">They got out there
with just five.</p>
<p t="681800" d="3270">And they did a
particular approach</p>
<p t="685070" d="2430">using what we could call
as the greedy algorithm.</p>
<p t="687500" d="2080">We've seen greedy
algorithms before.</p>
<p t="689580" d="2790">And they used another
greedy algorithm here.</p>
<p t="692370" d="4450">Now what their greedy strategy
did-- and I'm going to redo it</p>
<p t="696820" d="5950">here-- is stack all the
blocks right at the edge.</p>
<p t="702770" d="3910">Line it up here and,
starting at the top,</p>
<p t="706680" d="3550">push it out as
far as you can go.</p>
<p t="710230" d="3020">Now in this case, we can
get it out about halfway,</p>
<p t="713250" d="3639">because the center of mass of
this block is at halfway point.</p>
<p t="716889" d="1791">And that better be
sitting over this block,</p>
<p t="718680" d="2340">or it's going to tip.</p>
<p t="721020" d="2840">So the top block goes out here.</p>
<p t="723860" d="2730">Now I'm going to slide
the top two blocks out</p>
<p t="726590" d="1148">as far as they go.</p>
<p t="731240" d="550">All right.</p>
<p t="731790" d="1380">That's about the tip.</p>
<p t="733170" d="5330">Then I slide the top three
out as far as they go.</p>
<p t="738500" d="1340">Whoa!</p>
<p t="739840" d="2760">Almost.</p>
<p t="742600" d="1420">Oops.</p>
<p t="744020" d="3010">Theory is always
easier than practice.</p>
<p t="747030" d="3570">And now we do the
top four blocks.</p>
<p t="750600" d="3520">And they did a better
job than I did.</p>
<p t="754120" d="2840">But that's the algorithm,
OK, the greedy algorithm.</p>
<p t="756960" d="3060">The top i blocks-- when i
goes 1 to n-- push it out</p>
<p t="760020" d="1460">as far as you can go.</p>
<p t="761480" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="761980" d="5860">And we're going to
analyze that strategy</p>
<p t="767840" d="1268">and see how far it goes.</p>
<p t="777750" d="4660">So we're given n blocks.</p>
<p t="782410" d="2955">And let's say they all have
length 1, to make it easy.</p>
<p t="790130" d="4880">And we're going to define r
sub i to be the amount by which</p>
<p t="795010" d="2370">the i'th block hangs
out over the edge.</p>
<p t="810108" d="1583">and we're going to
count from the top.</p>
<p t="824830" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="825330" d="3940">So let's see this on a picture.</p>
<p t="829270" d="1810">So I got the table here.</p>
<p t="835220" d="6940">And then I'm stacking the blocks
out in some way like this.</p>
<p t="842160" d="2395">And with a greedy strategy,
you don't ever go backwards.</p>
<p t="852400" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="852900" d="3080">So I'm defining this distance.</p>
<p t="855980" d="3130">This is block one.</p>
<p t="859110" d="7130">This distance here is r 1.</p>
<p t="866240" d="5230">This distance is r 2.</p>
<p t="871470" d="3240">This one is r 3-- and so forth,
until you get down to here.</p>
<p t="874710" d="3370">This is r n, because
this is the n'th block,</p>
<p t="878080" d="2530">and it extends out
r n from the table.</p>
<p t="880610" d="2980">And this is 0 here,
which the table--</p>
<p t="883590" d="2270">we'll consider the table to
be the n plus first block.</p>
<p t="885860" d="4080">So r n plus 1 is 0.</p>
<p t="889940" d="1390">OK.</p>
<p t="891330" d="2490">And so using the strategy--
the greedy strategy--</p>
<p t="893820" d="2350">we want to know what's r 1?</p>
<p t="896170" d="3870">We want to compute that-- if
I keep pushing the blocks out</p>
<p t="900040" d="2930">in a topward fashion
as far as they'll go.</p>
<p t="902970" d="3880">Now the constraint is
the stability constraint</p>
<p t="906850" d="1321">so it won't fall over.</p>
<p t="915930" d="9040">The stability constraint says
that the center of mass--</p>
<p t="924970" d="12040">we'll call it C k--
of the top k blocks</p>
<p t="937010" d="3139">must lie on the k
plus first block.</p>
<p t="940149" d="1041">Otherwise it'll tip over.</p>
<p t="949090" d="4685">And of course the table is
block n plus 1 in this context.</p>
<p t="962100" d="740">OK.</p>
<p t="962840" d="4710">So if at any point
we've got k blocks,</p>
<p t="967550" d="3650">and their center of
mass is out here,</p>
<p t="971200" d="1840">they'll fall over at that point.</p>
<p t="973040" d="1810">Or if you are
building it this way,</p>
<p t="974850" d="1540">they would fall over that way.</p>
<p t="976390" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="976890" d="2790">So for each set of the top
k blocks, the center of mass</p>
<p t="979680" d="1600">has to be on the block below.</p>
<p t="981280" d="2020">And if it is, we're fine.</p>
<p t="983300" d="1302">It won't fall over.</p>
<p t="987410" d="1430">Now for the greedy stacking.</p>
<p t="999540" d="2400">Where is the center
of mass of the top k</p>
<p t="1001940" d="2690">blocks in the greedy
stacking, the way</p>
<p t="1004630" d="4640">we defined them in terms
of these variables.</p>
<p t="1009270" d="1176">What is C k?</p>
<p t="1014870" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="1015370" d="6820">So I got the top k
blocks r k plus 1.</p>
<p t="1022190" d="3899">The center of mass of the top
k blocks by the greedy strategy</p>
<p t="1026089" d="3260">is right at the edge
of the k'th block.</p>
<p t="1029349" d="5782">So if this is a block k here,
then this is r k plus 1.</p>
<p t="1035131" d="1458">That's where the
center of mass has</p>
<p t="1036589" d="3911">to be of all these
blocks-- the top k blocks.</p>
<p t="1040500" d="2770">If it's a little bit more,
it's going to fall over.</p>
<p t="1043270" d="2210">If it's less, then
it's not greedy.</p>
<p t="1045480" d="3030">We didn't push it out
as far as it could go.</p>
<p t="1048510" d="1500">All right.</p>
<p t="1050010" d="3240">So for the greedy stacking,
C k is equal to r k plus 1.</p>
<p t="1056550" d="5540">And r n plus 1 of course
is the edge of the table.</p>
<p t="1062090" d="740">That's zero.</p>
<p t="1065880" d="2660">Any questions so far?</p>
<p t="1068540" d="1960">What we're doing?</p>
<p t="1070500" d="1070">OK.</p>
<p t="1071570" d="510">All right.</p>
<p t="1072080" d="3100">So let's figure out where the
center of mass of the top k</p>
<p t="1075180" d="4420">blocks is-- a formula for
that-- a recursive formula.</p>
<p t="1079600" d="3680">So to do that we look
at the center of mass</p>
<p t="1083280" d="3690">of the k'th block by itself,
and then average it in with</p>
<p t="1086970" d="3581">the center of mass of
the top k minus 1 blocks.</p>
<p t="1090551" d="499">OK.</p>
<p t="1091050" d="4510">So we're going to set up a
recursion to compute C k.</p>
<p t="1095560" d="7590">Where is the center of mass of
the k'th block just by itself?</p>
<p t="1103150" d="3130">The center of mass
of the k'th block.</p>
<p t="1106280" d="500">This guy.</p>
<p t="1106780" d="3190">Where is its center of mass?</p>
<p t="1109970" d="900">AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p t="1112670" d="3170">PROFESSOR: Yeah, r
k plus 1 minus 0.5.</p>
<p t="1115840" d="2360">Because the center
of mass of this block</p>
<p t="1118200" d="2660">is 1/2 from the right edge.</p>
<p t="1120860" d="4590">And the right edge
is-- oh, it's r k.</p>
<p t="1125450" d="865">Sorry.</p>
<p t="1126315" d="585">All right?</p>
<p t="1126900" d="690">The top.</p>
<p t="1127590" d="970">Yeah this is.</p>
<p t="1128560" d="500">What?</p>
<p t="1129060" d="791">What did I do here?</p>
<p t="1129851" d="600">Oh, the top k.</p>
<p t="1130451" d="499">Sorry.</p>
<p t="1130950" d="2124">This is the k'th block,
the way I had it.</p>
<p t="1133074" d="666">Here's the k'th.</p>
<p t="1133740" d="2779">So it is r k minus a half.</p>
<p t="1136519" d="541">That's right.</p>
<p t="1137060" d="2101">This is r k plus 1 down here.</p>
<p t="1139161" d="499">All right.</p>
<p t="1139660" d="3070">Because the right edge of
the k'th block is at r k,</p>
<p t="1142730" d="3590">the center of mass
is 1/2 left of that.</p>
<p t="1146320" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="1146820" d="14040">So we know that the center of
mass of the k'th block is at r</p>
<p t="1160860" d="3320">k minus 1/2.</p>
<p t="1164180" d="690">All right.</p>
<p t="1164870" d="3110">Now we can compute another
expression for C k.</p>
<p t="1170520" d="15090">The center of mass
of the top k blocks</p>
<p t="1185610" d="8050">is C k equals-- well there's
k minus 1 block centered</p>
<p t="1193660" d="3330">at C k minus 1, because
the center of mass</p>
<p t="1196990" d="3190">of the top k minus 1 block's
by definition is C k minus 1.</p>
<p t="1200180" d="2730">And they have weight k minus 1.</p>
<p t="1202910" d="2790">And then we average that with
a k'th block that has weight 1</p>
<p t="1205700" d="3230">at position r k minus 1/2.</p>
<p t="1208930" d="5050">And the total weight of
this is k minus 1 here,</p>
<p t="1213980" d="2180">and one for this block.</p>
<p t="1216160" d="8000">So this equals KC
k minus 1 minus--</p>
<p t="1224160" d="1440">let me write it better here.</p>
<p t="1225600" d="2260">k minus 1.</p>
<p t="1227860" d="8280">C k minus 1 plus R k
minus 1/2 all over k.</p>
<p t="1236140" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="1236640" d="3030">So now we've got an expression--
a recursive expression--</p>
<p t="1239670" d="1110">for C k.</p>
<p t="1244820" d="3605">And to simplify it, we're
going to plug in that-- C k</p>
<p t="1248425" d="2045">as r k plus 1 for
the greedy strategy.</p>
<p t="1250470" d="1634">Yeah?</p>
<p t="1252104" d="2466">AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p t="1254570" d="1330">PROFESSOR: L is 1.</p>
<p t="1255900" d="3527">The length of the blocks is
1, here to make it simpler.</p>
<p t="1259427" d="1583">Otherwise it would
have been a half L.</p>
<p t="1261010" d="2880">So yesterday we talked
about length L blocks.</p>
<p t="1263890" d="2980">Today they're length
1, to be simple.</p>
<p t="1266870" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="1267370" d="1458">So now for the
greedy strategy, I'm</p>
<p t="1268828" d="3752">just going to plug
in C k as r k plus 1.</p>
<p t="1272580" d="3100">So let's do that.</p>
<p t="1275680" d="9150">So I got C k as r k plus
1 equals zero k minus 1.</p>
<p t="1284830" d="12260">Well C k minus 1 is just R
k plus R k minus 1/2 over K.</p>
<p t="1297090" d="6040">And this simplifies
to k r k minus r k</p>
<p t="1303130" d="5880">plus r k-- they cancel--
minus 1/2 over k.</p>
<p t="1309010" d="3780">This equals r k minus 1/2.</p>
<p t="1312790" d="3230">So getting very simple now.</p>
<p t="1316020" d="1760">And I'm just going
to rewrite this</p>
<p t="1317780" d="5170">to look at the difference
between r k and r k plus 1.</p>
<p t="1322950" d="4612">So r k minus r k plus 1 Oops.</p>
<p t="1327562" d="708">I made a mistake.</p>
<p t="1328270" d="1430">That's 1 over 2 k.</p>
<p t="1329700" d="2400">Half over k is 1 over 2K.</p>
<p t="1336500" d="4421">Any questions about
the math we did?</p>
<p t="1340921" d="499">Interesting.</p>
<p t="1341420" d="2550">This is one of those problems
where the math this way</p>
<p t="1343970" d="1129">is easy.</p>
<p t="1345099" d="2041">There are other ways to
try to solve this problem</p>
<p t="1347140" d="2240">and the math gets pretty hairy.</p>
<p t="1349380" d="2840">But this one's a
simple approach.</p>
<p t="1352220" d="1810">What's the meaning of this?</p>
<p t="1354030" d="5060">What's an interpretation
of r k minus r k plus 1?</p>
<p t="1359090" d="613">Yeah.</p>
<p t="1359703" d="875">AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p t="1362924" d="666">PROFESSOR: Yeah.</p>
<p t="1363590" d="3680">This is how much further the
k'th block sticks out over</p>
<p t="1367270" d="1890">the k plus first block.</p>
<p t="1369160" d="2238">So let's see that.</p>
<p t="1371398" d="772">All right.</p>
<p t="1372170" d="2060">So here's r 1.</p>
<p t="1374230" d="1790">Here's r 2.</p>
<p t="1376020" d="4330">r 1 minus r 2 is the amount by
which the first block sticks</p>
<p t="1380350" d="1660">out over the second.</p>
<p t="1382010" d="2690">Here's r 2 two minus r 3.</p>
<p t="1384700" d="2141">It's that distance.</p>
<p t="1386841" d="499">All right.</p>
<p t="1387340" d="4420">So we've gotten a formula for
the greedy strategy of how much</p>
<p t="1391760" d="3870">the k'th block sticks out
over the k plus first block.</p>
<p t="1395630" d="1681">And it's pretty simple.</p>
<p t="1397311" d="499">All right.</p>
<p t="1397810" d="4930">So now we can write
down this expression</p>
<p t="1402740" d="2600">for all the values of k.</p>
<p t="1405340" d="5280">So what's r 1 minus r 2 going
to be in the greedy strategy?</p>
<p t="1410620" d="1860">How much is the top
block sticking out</p>
<p t="1412480" d="5650">over the second block
in the greedy strategy?</p>
<p t="1418130" d="730">1/2.</p>
<p t="1418860" d="3280">Just plug in k equals 1.</p>
<p t="1422140" d="4618">r 2 minus r 3 equals--</p>
<p t="1426758" d="2347">AUDIENCE: A quarter.</p>
<p t="1429105" d="1775">One quarter.</p>
<p t="1430880" d="5550">r 3 minus r 4 is what?</p>
<p t="1436430" d="840">6.</p>
<p t="1437270" d="680">All right.</p>
<p t="1437950" d="2080">So now you can start to
see what the TAs did,</p>
<p t="1440030" d="2960">how it got smaller
each step going down</p>
<p t="1442990" d="1260">all the way to the end here.</p>
<p t="1444250" d="9076">You get r n-- the n'th block--
minus the table is 1 over 2 n.</p>
<p t="1453326" d="684">All right.</p>
<p t="1454010" d="1970">Now there's a very
easy way to figure out</p>
<p t="1455980" d="3990">what r 1 is, which
is what we're after.</p>
<p t="1459970" d="1660">How far out is the top block?</p>
<p t="1461630" d="3250">What do I do?</p>
<p t="1464880" d="3290">Add them all together.</p>
<p t="1468170" d="3350">And everything cancels.</p>
<p t="1471520" d="7910">So I get r 1 minus r n
plus 1 equals 1/2 plus 1/4</p>
<p t="1479430" d="4480">plus 1/6 out to 1 over 2 n.</p>
<p t="1486851" d="499">All right.</p>
<p t="1487350" d="7860">So that's just equal to the
sum i equal 1 to n 1 over 2 1.</p>
<p t="1495210" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="1495710" d="4280">Now I got r 1 minus r n plus 1.</p>
<p t="1499990" d="3820">But what's r n plus 1?</p>
<p t="1503810" d="540">0.</p>
<p t="1504350" d="730">That's the table.</p>
<p t="1505080" d="1900">The table doesn't
hang out over itself.</p>
<p t="1506980" d="9340">So in fact r 1 equals a half
of the sum of the inverses</p>
<p t="1516320" d="1100">of the first n integers.</p>
<p t="1520130" d="1330">OK?</p>
<p t="1521460" d="4300">And so now all we have to
do is to compute this sum</p>
<p t="1525760" d="2590">to know how far out it is.</p>
<p t="1528350" d="2740">In fact, this sum
comes up so often</p>
<p t="1531090" d="3170">in mathematics and computer
science, it has a special name.</p>
<p t="1534260" d="1890">It's called the harmonic sum.</p>
<p t="1536150" d="3640">And the numbers are called
the harmonic numbers.</p>
<p t="1539790" d="10070">And in particular, the
n'th harmonic number</p>
<p t="1549860" d="4130">is typically denoted
H n just equals</p>
<p t="1553990" d="1665">the sum of the n reciprocals.</p>
<p t="1560310" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="1560810" d="4000">So for example, the first
harmonic number is 1.</p>
<p t="1564810" d="5700">The second is 1
plus 1/2 equals 3/2.</p>
<p t="1570510" d="10620">The third is 3/2 plus
1/3, which is 11/6.</p>
<p t="1581130" d="6210">The fourth harmonic
number is that plus 1/4.</p>
<p t="1587340" d="2476">22 plus 3/12 is 25/12.</p>
<p t="1592449" d="1541">That's sort of an
interesting number,</p>
<p t="1593990" d="3390">because it's bigger than 2.</p>
<p t="1597380" d="2311">What does that tell us?</p>
<p t="1599691" d="1874">Why is that interesting
from this perspective</p>
<p t="1601565" d="3225">of what we're doing here?</p>
<p t="1604790" d="2280">Now you can get a
block off the table.</p>
<p t="1607070" d="3160">Because R1, the distance
that the top block hangs out</p>
<p t="1610230" d="3460">off the table, is half
the harmonic number.</p>
<p t="1613690" d="4240">Half of H 4 is a little
bit bigger than 1.</p>
<p t="1617930" d="4650">Which means with four blocks the
top block can be off the table.</p>
<p t="1622580" d="2300">Now the TAs did it using five.</p>
<p t="1624880" d="1900">I didn't even get it
to work with five.</p>
<p t="1626780" d="2170">In theory it'll work with 12.</p>
<p t="1628950" d="2430">You can hang one out
there just a 24th</p>
<p t="1631380" d="3660">beyond the edge of
the table in theory.</p>
<p t="1635040" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="1635540" d="4380">If we kept on going,
h of a million--</p>
<p t="1639920" d="3570">the millionth harmonic number,
if you were to go compute it,</p>
<p t="1643490" d="5510">is 14.3927 and some other stuff.</p>
<p t="1649000" d="3910">So if I had a million
blocks stacked up, in theory</p>
<p t="1652910" d="4320">how far would I get the
top block off the table?</p>
<p t="1657230" d="1680">Seven blocks.</p>
<p t="1658910" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="1659410" d="1083">So that gives you an idea.</p>
<p t="1660493" d="3527">You have to do a lot
of work to get seven.</p>
<p t="1664020" d="2700">And in fact it's hard,
because the bottom block</p>
<p t="1666720" d="2780">would be hanging out one
two millionth of a block.</p>
<p t="1669500" d="500">All right?</p>
<p t="1670000" d="1670">So you're adding up
a lot of tiny things</p>
<p t="1671670" d="1130">to get to seven out there.</p>
<p t="1674460" d="2400">Now it turns out that
the harmonic numbers</p>
<p t="1676860" d="1869">grow to infinity.</p>
<p t="1678729" d="791">And we'll see that.</p>
<p t="1679520" d="3240">But they grow very, very slowly.</p>
<p t="1682760" d="3130">And to see that, we need to
get a closed-form expression</p>
<p t="1685890" d="2240">for this sum.</p>
<p t="1688130" d="3080">Now does anybody know a
closed-form expression</p>
<p t="1691210" d="3480">for the sum of 1 over i?</p>
<p t="1694690" d="2060">I don't think so,
because I don't</p>
<p t="1696750" d="3825">know anybody who knows that.</p>
<p t="1700575" d="4575">In fact it's [? probably ?]
believed that it doesn't exist.</p>
<p t="1705150" d="5058">So what do we do to get a
good estimation of that sum?</p>
<p t="1714360" d="1492">What do we do?</p>
<p t="1715852" d="1208">AUDIENCE: Integration bounds.</p>
<p t="1717060" d="1050">PROFESSOR: The
integration bounds.</p>
<p t="1718110" d="340">Yeah.</p>
<p t="1718450" d="1960">Because we're not going
to get a closed form.</p>
<p t="1720410" d="3850">At least I don't know of
anybody who knows how to do it.</p>
<p t="1724260" d="1550">So we'll use the
integration bounds.</p>
<p t="1737260" d="2200">And what kind of
function are we summing?</p>
<p t="1739460" d="3540">Is it increasing or decreasing?</p>
<p t="1743000" d="660">Decreasing.</p>
<p t="1743660" d="2130">Yep.</p>
<p t="1745790" d="2368">So we'll use the formula
we did last time.</p>
<p t="1754221" d="499">All right.</p>
<p t="1754720" d="9260">And that formula is that the
sum i equals 1 to n of f of i</p>
<p t="1763980" d="4062">is, at most, the first
term plus the integral.</p>
<p t="1771730" d="3640">And it's at least the last
term plus the integral.</p>
<p t="1782100" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="1782600" d="3080">In this case we have
f of i as 1 over i.</p>
<p t="1791140" d="3057">So the first step is to
compute the integral.</p>
<p t="1802250" d="1280">And that's pretty easy.</p>
<p t="1803530" d="4990">That's just the natural log
of x evaluated at n and 1.</p>
<p t="1808520" d="1550">And that's easy.</p>
<p t="1810070" d="2920">That's just the
natural log of n.</p>
<p t="1812990" d="2940">So the integral
is very easy here.</p>
<p t="1815930" d="1790">And now we actually
can just plug in</p>
<p t="1817720" d="1163">and get really good bounds.</p>
<p t="1822100" d="1768">Maybe I'll save
that just in case.</p>
<p t="1842600" d="4140">OK so plugging in
into the bounds f of n</p>
<p t="1846740" d="4880">is 1 over n plus the
integral is log of n</p>
<p t="1851620" d="3240">is less than or equal to
the n'th harmonic number.</p>
<p t="1854860" d="2330">And it's upper
bounded by f of 1,</p>
<p t="1857190" d="4608">which is 1 plus the integral.</p>
<p t="1861798" d="752">All right.</p>
<p t="1862550" d="970">So that's really good.</p>
<p t="1863520" d="1890">We got very tight bounds.</p>
<p t="1865410" d="2810">And now you can see that
the n'th harmonic number--</p>
<p t="1868220" d="1580">how fast is it growing?</p>
<p t="1869800" d="4820">If I were to use tilde
notation, what would I write?</p>
<p t="1874620" d="761">As log n.</p>
<p t="1875381" d="499">Yeah.</p>
<p t="1875880" d="4167">So this means that h
of n is tilde log of n.</p>
<p t="1882750" d="2330">Now this is such an
important function</p>
<p t="1885080" d="2560">that people have gone
to a lot of extra work--</p>
<p t="1887640" d="5170">which we can't do in this
class-- to really nail down</p>
<p t="1892810" d="1450">the value-- get it much closer.</p>
<p t="1894260" d="6300">And in fact it's now known
that it's the natural log of n</p>
<p t="1900560" d="8800">plus 1 over 2n plus 1 over
12n squared plus epsilon of n</p>
<p t="1909360" d="8720">over 120n to the
fourth where for all n</p>
<p t="1918080" d="2650">epsilon n is between 0 and 1.</p>
<p t="1924661" d="499">Oop.</p>
<p t="1925160" d="3070">And I left one piece out.</p>
<p t="1928230" d="3760">Actually there's a constant
term in here-- delta--</p>
<p t="1931990" d="3240">that's called Euler's constant.</p>
<p t="1935230" d="6400">Delta is called
Euler's constant,</p>
<p t="1941630" d="10501">and equals 0.577215664
and some other stuff.</p>
<p t="1952131" d="1499">And in fact to this
day people don't</p>
<p t="1953630" d="4130">know if this constant is
rational or irrational.</p>
<p t="1957760" d="4440">But they know it to a
lot of decimal places.</p>
<p t="1962200" d="6050">So basically H n is the log of n
plus some fixed value between 0</p>
<p t="1968250" d="1860">and 1-- as we knew
it had to be--</p>
<p t="1970110" d="2010">plus even some tail
terms here that</p>
<p t="1972120" d="3510">get very small as n gets large.</p>
<p t="1975630" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="1976130" d="3940">So say I wanted to using
this greedy strategy.</p>
<p t="1980070" d="4680">How many blocks I would need
to get a block 100 blocks out</p>
<p t="1984750" d="1950">over the end of the table.</p>
<p t="1986700" d="2600">So I want to go 100 blocks out.</p>
<p t="1989300" d="4580">How many blocks do I need
using this strategy, roughly?</p>
<p t="1998090" d="2300">What is it?</p>
<p t="2000390" d="2800">I think somebody said it.</p>
<p t="2003190" d="6830">So I want to get r 1 to be 100.</p>
<p t="2010020" d="6050">So I need the harmonic
number to be 200.</p>
<p t="2016070" d="4331">And what does this tell me
about n to get this to be 200?</p>
<p t="2023840" d="1260">e to the 200.</p>
<p t="2025100" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="2025600" d="2430">So you're going to
need an exponential</p>
<p t="2028030" d="3320">in 200 number of blocks, which
now we're past the stars,</p>
<p t="2031350" d="2990">all right, to get that many.</p>
<p t="2034340" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="2034840" d="4640">Now we won't prove it in class,
but this strategy-- the TA</p>
<p t="2039480" d="3230">greedy strategy-- is optimal.</p>
<p t="2042710" d="4950">There is no way to get a block
farther out over the edge.</p>
<p t="2047660" d="3420">That said, there is a
second way to get there.</p>
<p t="2051080" d="4300">And in the second way, the top
block is not the optimal block.</p>
<p t="2055380" d="2816">In the second way, it's the
second block that goes out.</p>
<p t="2058196" d="1333">So it looks something like that.</p>
<p t="2059529" d="2201">So there's a
counterweight on it.</p>
<p t="2061730" d="2590">And in the text, when
you read chapter nine,</p>
<p t="2064320" d="3379">you will see the proof
that shows that there's</p>
<p t="2067699" d="1301">two solutions that are optimal.</p>
<p t="2069000" d="1666">One's a greedy, and
one's this other one</p>
<p t="2070666" d="2933">that sort of is mostly the
greedy, except the top couple</p>
<p t="2073599" d="1211">of blocks are different.</p>
<p t="2074810" d="1340">And it proves that's optimal.</p>
<p t="2076150" d="1640">We won't cover that in class.</p>
<p t="2080580" d="2250">Now actually in the
literature today people</p>
<p t="2082830" d="3070">have been studying how
far a block can go out</p>
<p t="2085900" d="2410">if you're allowed to do more
than one block per level,</p>
<p t="2088310" d="2560">like one of the
students wanted to do.</p>
<p t="2090870" d="2559">So if you're allowed
to have multiple blocks</p>
<p t="2093429" d="4031">on the same level, it turns
out you can get much farther</p>
<p t="2097460" d="1440">out with n blocks.</p>
<p t="2098900" d="3500">And right now it's known
that it's something like n</p>
<p t="2102400" d="2430">to the third is how
far you can get out,</p>
<p t="2104830" d="2480">which is much better
than log of n.</p>
<p t="2107310" d="3640">And so mathematicians have
been studying that problem.</p>
<p t="2110950" d="4470">Any questions about
the block stacking?</p>
<p t="2118360" d="971">OK.</p>
<p t="2119331" d="499">All right.</p>
<p t="2119830" d="4300">So that's basically it for sums.</p>
<p t="2124130" d="3060">I do want to spend a little
time talking about products.</p>
<p t="2127190" d="2150">And that may get us back
into sums pretty quick.</p>
<p t="2132410" d="5280">The most famous product
out there is n factorial.</p>
<p t="2137690" d="3210">And once we get to
counting and probability,</p>
<p t="2140900" d="1510">probably every
lecture we're going</p>
<p t="2142410" d="3120">to be looking at n factorial
one way or another.</p>
<p t="2145530" d="3065">Just comes up all the time.</p>
<p t="2148595" d="6015">n factorial is the product
of i equals 1 to n of i.</p>
<p t="2154610" d="7920">It's the product of the first
n natural numbers after zero.</p>
<p t="2162530" d="2750">Now we'd like to be able to
get a closed-form expression</p>
<p t="2165280" d="2320">for this, because factorial
is really not closed form,</p>
<p t="2167600" d="3270">because it's hiding this thing.</p>
<p t="2170870" d="4170">And if I ask you how big is
n factorial, sort of hard</p>
<p t="2175040" d="4520">to say how big it is,
how fast it grows.</p>
<p t="2179560" d="5410">Any ideas about how we might
go about doing a product to get</p>
<p t="2184970" d="1706">a closed-form expression?</p>
<p t="2186676" d="1958">AUDIENCE: If you take a
logarithm of a product,</p>
<p t="2188634" d="1136">you get a sum.</p>
<p t="2189770" d="1400">PROFESSOR: Yeah, good.</p>
<p t="2191170" d="1171">Take the log of it.</p>
<p t="2196970" d="7010">Well, let's write that out--
1 times 2 times 3 to n.</p>
<p t="2203980" d="3490">That equals the log of
1 plus the log of 2.</p>
<p t="2210347" d="500">Whoops.</p>
<p t="2213441" d="499">All right.</p>
<p t="2213940" d="1480">So I've now got a sum.</p>
<p t="2221005" d="4145">And now that I've got a sum
we can use all the tools</p>
<p t="2225150" d="1500">we had for sums.</p>
<p t="2226650" d="3100">So really, products
look hairy, but they're</p>
<p t="2229750" d="1649">no different than sums.</p>
<p t="2231399" d="1791">Because we're going to
get an approximation</p>
<p t="2233190" d="2450">or get an answer for
[? login ?] n factorial.</p>
<p t="2235640" d="3020">Then we'll exponentiate it,
and we'll have the answer.</p>
<p t="2238660" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="2239160" d="2380">So we're looking at this sum.</p>
<p t="2241540" d="4660">And so how do I get a
closed form for that?</p>
<p t="2246200" d="3810">Turns out nobody
knows the closed form.</p>
<p t="2250010" d="5090">But we do know a method that
approximates it very well,</p>
<p t="2255100" d="4370">which is the integration bounce.</p>
<p t="2259470" d="3980">Only in this case, it's
an increasing function.</p>
<p t="2263450" d="870">So let's do that.</p>
<p t="2285450" d="510">OK.</p>
<p t="2285960" d="970">So let's do that.</p>
<p t="2301620" d="1140">And the formula is easy.</p>
<p t="2302760" d="3010">It's basically the same
formula we had there--</p>
<p t="2305770" d="4970">that the sum i equals
1 to n of f of i</p>
<p t="2310740" d="4256">is at most the n'th
term plus the integral.</p>
<p t="2317950" d="4640">And it's at least the first
term plus the integral.</p>
<p t="2327006" d="754">All right.</p>
<p t="2327760" d="3405">Now in this case f
of i is the log of i.</p>
<p t="2334890" d="8410">And so we need to compute
the integral of log of x.</p>
<p t="2343300" d="760">And that's easy.</p>
<p t="2344060" d="7890">That's x ln of x minus
x evaluated at n and 1.</p>
<p t="2351950" d="3691">And that's just n
log of n minus n.</p>
<p t="2359410" d="3840">If I plug in 1, I get a 0 here,
and I'm subtracting negative 1</p>
<p t="2363250" d="2651">there.</p>
<p t="2365901" d="499">All right.</p>
<p t="2366400" d="4233">And so now we'll just plug
this into the integral</p>
<p t="2370633" d="1041">and we'll get our bounce.</p>
<p t="2374890" d="2810">So f of 1.</p>
<p t="2377700" d="4670">What is f of 1 in this case?</p>
<p t="2382370" d="2610">Yeah, 0.</p>
<p t="2384980" d="7160">Plus n ln n minus
n plus 1 less than</p>
<p t="2392140" d="7440">equal to log of n factorial,
less than or equal to f of n</p>
<p t="2399580" d="1190">is log of n.</p>
<p t="2407830" d="1510">OK.</p>
<p t="2409340" d="2350">So to get bounds on
n factorial, we just</p>
<p t="2411690" d="3080">exponentiate both sides.</p>
<p t="2414770" d="3530">So I take e to this,
gives me-- well, that's</p>
<p t="2418300" d="4905">going to give n to the n here.</p>
<p t="2423205" d="875">And this is negative.</p>
<p t="2424080" d="1742">That'll be e to the n minus 1.</p>
<p t="2429690" d="4480">And here I've got n plus
1 times the log of n.</p>
<p t="2434170" d="4510">So it's n to the n plus
1 over the same thing--</p>
<p t="2438680" d="3030">e to the n minus 1.</p>
<p t="2441710" d="1450">So we got very close bounds.</p>
<p t="2443160" d="3410">They're within a factor of
n-- which sounds like a lot,</p>
<p t="2446570" d="3880">but compared to how big n
factorial is, not so bad.</p>
<p t="2450450" d="3755">Pretty good bounds there.</p>
<p t="2454205" d="500">OK.</p>
<p t="2457470" d="4100">So n factorial's about n
over e to the n'th power.</p>
<p t="2461570" d="3610">Now this is so important
that-- even more important</p>
<p t="2465180" d="2880">than harmonic numbers-- people
have gone to a lot of effort</p>
<p t="2468060" d="2910">to get very tight
bounds on n factorial.</p>
<p t="2470970" d="1416">So let me tell you
what those are.</p>
<p t="2479754" d="1291">It's called Stirling's formula.</p>
<p t="2490510" d="5140">And that says that n
factorial equals n over e</p>
<p t="2495650" d="6580">to the n'th power times the
square root of 2 pi n times</p>
<p t="2502230" d="12540">e to the epsilon n where
epsilon n is between 1 over 12n</p>
<p t="2514770" d="5900">plus 1 and 1 over 12n.</p>
<p t="2520670" d="3760">So it's epsilon n is
going to 0 as n gets big.</p>
<p t="2524430" d="3491">So e to something going
to 0 is going to 1.</p>
<p t="2527921" d="499">All right.</p>
<p t="2528420" d="2580">So another way of
looking at this</p>
<p t="2531000" d="2270">is you could put a
tilde here, all right,</p>
<p t="2533270" d="1220">and ignore that term.</p>
<p t="2534490" d="1820">And that's called
Stirling's formula.</p>
<p t="2536310" d="3360">This is a good thing to
have on your crib sheet</p>
<p t="2539670" d="1440">for the midterm.</p>
<p t="2541110" d="1930">So very likely
there'll be something</p>
<p t="2543040" d="2660">where you've got to have
some kind of analysis</p>
<p t="2545700" d="5670">of n factorial, and to
know how fast it's growing.</p>
<p t="2551370" d="3490">Now these bounds you
get here are very tight.</p>
<p t="2554860" d="7470">For example, 100
factorial is at least 100</p>
<p t="2562330" d="8190">over e to 100 times square
root 200 pi, times e to the 1</p>
<p t="2570520" d="2440">over 1,201.</p>
<p t="2572960" d="1920">This thing is just really tiny.</p>
<p t="2574880" d="8200">This thing here is
1.0008329 and something.</p>
<p t="2583080" d="3630">And 100 factorial
is lower-bounded</p>
<p t="2586710" d="8330">by the same things, only here
it's e to the 1 over 1,200.</p>
<p t="2595040" d="9060">And that is very close
to 1-- 1.00083368.</p>
<p t="2604100" d="2750">So the difference
in these bounds</p>
<p t="2606850" d="3920">is a tiny fraction of 1%.</p>
<p t="2610770" d="2590">So the bound you get
from Stirling's formula</p>
<p t="2613360" d="2116">is very, very close
to the right answer.</p>
<p t="2621910" d="4749">Any questions on
Stirling's formula?</p>
<p t="2626659" d="791">We won't derive it.</p>
<p t="2627450" d="1957">You can derive that in
a graduate math class.</p>
<p t="2629407" d="958">They do that sometimes.</p>
<p t="2633380" d="2235">More typically you'll
see it without that e</p>
<p t="2635615" d="1325">to the error term.</p>
<p t="2636940" d="1600">And you just see n
factorial written</p>
<p t="2638540" d="7390">as tilde, and over e to
the n, square root 2 pi n.</p>
<p t="2645930" d="500">All right?</p>
<p t="2646430" d="4180">Because that e to the epsilon
n goes to 1 in the limit.</p>
<p t="2650610" d="3880">So it sort of disappears when
you go to the tilde notation.</p>
<p t="2654490" d="2410">And this in fact is
a lower bound on n</p>
<p t="2656900" d="4610">factorial, and very close
to the right answer.</p>
<p t="2661510" d="3500">Now this is sort of
an amazing formula.</p>
<p t="2665010" d="4000">I mean who would think that
when you look at n factorial</p>
<p t="2669010" d="3630">that the expression
would have e and pi</p>
<p t="2672640" d="1480">in the expression for it?</p>
<p t="2674120" d="810">Maybe e.</p>
<p t="2674930" d="710">Maybe.</p>
<p t="2675640" d="3690">But what's pi doing
in n factorial?</p>
<p t="2679330" d="4080">It's sort of a bizarre thing.</p>
<p t="2683410" d="1060">OK.</p>
<p t="2684470" d="1190">That's it for products.</p>
<p t="2685660" d="1625">We're just going to
do the one example,</p>
<p t="2687285" d="3245">because really any product just
becomes a sum through the log.</p>
<p t="2690530" d="2060">And that makes it really easy.</p>
<p t="2692590" d="4310">Any questions on
sums and products?</p>
<p t="2696900" d="4040">Because I'm going to totally
change gears now and talk</p>
<p t="2700940" d="1820">about more things like tilde.</p>
<p t="2705297" d="499">OK.</p>
<p t="2710170" d="5170">So we're going to talk today
and tomorrow in recitation</p>
<p t="2715340" d="3350">about asymptotic notation.</p>
<p t="2718690" d="5440">It is used all over the
place in computer science.</p>
<p t="2724130" d="4680">We've already seen one example,
which is the tilde notation.</p>
<p t="2728810" d="4340">And it turns out there's
five more things like that</p>
<p t="2733150" d="2761">which we're going to learn what
they are and how they work.</p>
<p t="2742790" d="3740">They're used to
explain or describe how</p>
<p t="2746530" d="3800">a function grows in the limit.</p>
<p t="2750330" d="4210">So for example, we had
the tilde notation.</p>
<p t="2754540" d="10140">And we wrote f of x is tilde
g of x if the limit as x goes</p>
<p t="2764680" d="6543">to infinity of f over g is 1.</p>
<p t="2773880" d="2400">Now the next one--
and most commonly</p>
<p t="2776280" d="1630">used one in computer
science-- is</p>
<p t="2777910" d="5290">called the O notation,
or the big O.</p>
<p t="2783200" d="1560">And it's written like this.</p>
<p t="2784760" d="6340">f of x equals O of g of x.</p>
<p t="2791100" d="6000">And it means that
the limit as x goes</p>
<p t="2797100" d="3460">to infinity of the
absolute value of f</p>
<p t="2800560" d="5950">of x over g of x
is convergence--</p>
<p t="2806510" d="1700">is less than infinity.</p>
<p t="2808210" d="7550">So it's finite, and
it can't diverge.</p>
<p t="2815760" d="4970">The interpretation
is that this function</p>
<p t="2820730" d="5130">is up to constant factors
upper-bounded by this one,</p>
<p t="2825860" d="5830">that this grows the same rate
or slower than this one grows</p>
<p t="2831690" d="2190">as x gets large.</p>
<p t="2833880" d="4570">Because if f was growing a lot
faster than g in the limit,</p>
<p t="2838450" d="2070">then the limit would be
the ratio is infinity.</p>
<p t="2840520" d="2001">And we're saying
that doesn't happen.</p>
<p t="2842521" d="499">All right.</p>
<p t="2843020" d="2610">I'm not going to do a
lot of examples for this.</p>
<p t="2849600" d="1800">In fact, let's go over here.</p>
<p t="2851400" d="2144">There's several other ways
you'll see it written.</p>
<p t="2870980" d="2480">For example, you'll
see people write</p>
<p t="2873460" d="3810">f of x is less
than or equal to O</p>
<p t="2877270" d="4280">of g of x, because the
natural interpretation is</p>
<p t="2881550" d="4400">f is not growing faster than
g-- sort of upper-bounded by g.</p>
<p t="2885950" d="7110">You'll see people write
f of x is O of g of x.</p>
<p t="2893060" d="3380">And the formal math way
that people don't use,</p>
<p t="2896440" d="2150">but it's the
formally correct one,</p>
<p t="2898590" d="5160">is f of x is an
element of O of g of x.</p>
<p t="2903750" d="3140">And the interpretation
there is that O of g of x</p>
<p t="2906890" d="3060">is a set of functions that
don't grow any faster than g.</p>
<p t="2909950" d="1860">And f is one of them.</p>
<p t="2911810" d="2547">You can use any of
these and that's fine.</p>
<p t="2914357" d="1708">People will know what
you mean, and it'll</p>
<p t="2916065" d="2495">be fine for the class.</p>
<p t="2918560" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="2919060" d="5453">Let's see some examples, and see
how to prove a big O relation.</p>
<p t="2927300" d="4180">Let f of x be the
function x, and g</p>
<p t="2931480" d="4190">of x be the function x squared.</p>
<p t="2935670" d="4230">Then in this case
f of x is O of g</p>
<p t="2939900" d="5380">of x-- because x doesn't
grow any faster than x</p>
<p t="2945280" d="1660">squared as x gets large.</p>
<p t="2946940" d="4570">To prove it, we
take the limit as x</p>
<p t="2951510" d="7190">goes to infinity of
x over x squared.</p>
<p t="2958700" d="2340">That is equal to what?</p>
<p t="2961040" d="4880">What is the limit of x over x
squared as x goes to infinity?</p>
<p t="2965920" d="2430">0.</p>
<p t="2968350" d="3650">And that is less than infinity.</p>
<p t="2972000" d="1960">So we proved it.</p>
<p t="2973960" d="6390">So if you get asked to prove
f is O of g, what you do</p>
<p t="2980350" d="4510">is you take the limit of f
over g as x goes to infinity</p>
<p t="2984860" d="3011">and show that it
doesn't diverge.</p>
<p t="2987871" d="659">All right.</p>
<p t="2988530" d="3728">Let's do another example.</p>
<p t="2992258" d="3142">In this case we'll show
that f is not O of g.</p>
<p t="3002270" d="3962">x squared is not O of x.</p>
<p t="3006232" d="2128">Of course, x squared
grows faster than x,</p>
<p t="3008360" d="1423">but let's see why not.</p>
<p t="3012670" d="3340">Well we take the limit
as x goes to infinity</p>
<p t="3016010" d="5120">of x squared over x.</p>
<p t="3021130" d="2790">And what is that limit?</p>
<p t="3023920" d="1950">Infinity.</p>
<p t="3025870" d="2490">And so it can't be true
that it's x squared</p>
<p t="3028360" d="3181">is O of x, because it has
to be less than infinity.</p>
<p t="3031541" d="755">Yeah?</p>
<p t="3032296" d="666">AUDIENCE: Sorry.</p>
<p t="3032962" d="857">I missed it.</p>
<p t="3033819" d="541">What's alpha?</p>
<p t="3037227" d="833">PROFESSOR: Infinity.</p>
<p t="3041180" d="590">Sorry.</p>
<p t="3041770" d="280">Infinity.</p>
<p t="3042050" d="300">There we go.</p>
<p t="3042350" d="1458">That's important
in the definition.</p>
<p t="3043808" d="955">Yep.</p>
<p t="3044763" d="500">Good.</p>
<p t="3048890" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="3049390" d="2800">What about this?</p>
<p t="3052190" d="7260">Is x squared equal O
of a million times x?</p>
<p t="3064750" d="880">Yes?</p>
<p t="3065630" d="2181">No?</p>
<p t="3067811" d="749">What do you think?</p>
<p t="3072100" d="2066">This looks pretty darn big.</p>
<p t="3074166" d="1304">AUDIENCE: It's a constant.</p>
<p t="3075470" d="2280">PROFESSOR: That a constant.</p>
<p t="3077750" d="5920">So in the limit, as x goes
to infinity, this over that</p>
<p t="3083670" d="1871">is infinite.</p>
<p t="3085541" d="499">All right.</p>
<p t="3086040" d="2680">So no.</p>
<p t="3088720" d="3530">Because the limit of
x goes to infinity</p>
<p t="3092250" d="7930">of x squared over 10 to the
sixth x, that equals infinity.</p>
<p t="3100180" d="3120">So the thing with
this big O notation</p>
<p t="3103300" d="2090">is you just ignore
our constant factors.</p>
<p t="3105390" d="1260">They don't do anything.</p>
<p t="3106650" d="1264">Just forget about them.</p>
<p t="3111690" d="1000">What about this?</p>
<p t="3112690" d="7138">Is 10 to the sixth x
equal O of x squared?</p>
<p t="3123170" d="1840">Yes.</p>
<p t="3125010" d="1809">Because you just
ignore the constant.</p>
<p t="3126819" d="1541">That's what the big
O is for, and why</p>
<p t="3128360" d="2450">it's used all the time
in computer science.</p>
<p t="3130810" d="2860">So yes, that's true.</p>
<p t="3133670" d="2590">The proof is very simple.</p>
<p t="3136260" d="7020">The limit as x goes to infinity
of 100 x squared-- whoops.</p>
<p t="3143280" d="1830">I could even put a square there.</p>
<p t="3145110" d="6670">10 to the sixth x squared over
x squared is 10 to the sixth.</p>
<p t="3151780" d="1300">That's less than infinity.</p>
<p t="3157000" d="3380">In fact, I could take
any quadratic polynomial.</p>
<p t="3160380" d="7030">x squared plus 100x plus 10 to
the seventh is O of x squared.</p>
<p t="3169970" d="2170">Because smaller order
terms don't matter.</p>
<p t="3172140" d="4740">The limit of this here over
that in that case is 1.</p>
<p t="3176880" d="2312">So it's less than
infinity as x gets big.</p>
<p t="3182050" d="2186">All right let's do a few more.</p>
<p t="3189200" d="1460">This really is not so hard.</p>
<p t="3190660" d="2110">It's a little dull.</p>
<p t="3192770" d="3631">But you've got to
know it for later.</p>
<p t="3201460" d="500">OK.</p>
<p t="3201960" d="2780">I could take classes like
6046, and you'll never</p>
<p t="3204740" d="3300">see any constants, because
everything is things like big O</p>
<p t="3208040" d="3000">and the other notation
we'll talk about.</p>
<p t="3211040" d="1010">What about this?</p>
<p t="3212050" d="5440">X to the 10th equal
O of e to the x.</p>
<p t="3220720" d="2455">Is x to the 10 O of e to the x?</p>
<p t="3226390" d="2350">Yeah, it is.</p>
<p t="3228740" d="1130">So this is a theorem.</p>
<p t="3233250" d="1990">Proof.</p>
<p t="3235240" d="2490">Limit as x goes to infinity.</p>
<p t="3237730" d="2950">x to the 10 over e to the x.</p>
<p t="3240680" d="2505">That equals 0, which is
certainly less than infinity.</p>
<p t="3245810" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="3246310" d="1760">Now the reason this
stuff is useful</p>
<p t="3248070" d="3240">when you're doing the
analysis of algorithms</p>
<p t="3251310" d="2280">is because when you're
talking about things</p>
<p t="3253590" d="3820">like matrix multiplication
algorithms or things like that,</p>
<p t="3257410" d="3170">the actual running time
depends on the machine you're</p>
<p t="3260580" d="4370">dealing with-- the machine
characteristics-- details</p>
<p t="3264950" d="2147">in how you count steps
of the algorithm.</p>
<p t="3267097" d="1708">For example, doing
matrix multiplication,</p>
<p t="3268805" d="4355">do you count multiply different
than you count plus addition?</p>
<p t="3273160" d="4280">And if you start getting
caught up in all those details</p>
<p t="3277440" d="2440">you lose the important
fact of the algorithm.</p>
<p t="3279880" d="1560">For example, matrix
multiplication--</p>
<p t="3281440" d="5880">the elementary algorithm takes
order O of n cubed steps.</p>
<p t="3287320" d="1610">And that's the important fact.</p>
<p t="3288930" d="4140">And it tells you that if you
double the size of the matrix</p>
<p t="3293070" d="2890">the running time will increase
by at most a factor of eight</p>
<p t="3295960" d="2930">in the limit as n gets large.</p>
<p t="3298890" d="4410">And so you might write
things like the time</p>
<p t="3303300" d="5150">to multiply n by n matrices.</p>
<p t="3312810" d="4180">You might call that t of n,
and then state that is O of n</p>
<p t="3316990" d="2400">cubed.</p>
<p t="3319390" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="3319890" d="2080">And you don't have to
worry about what computer</p>
<p t="3321970" d="2500">it's running on,
exactly how you're</p>
<p t="3324470" d="3110">counting the details of what
a step is or what time is.</p>
<p t="3327580" d="2770">The important thing
is that it's growing</p>
<p t="3330350" d="5140">at most as a cubic of
the size of the matrices.</p>
<p t="3335490" d="6240">And so in 6046 and 6006
you will spend lots of time</p>
<p t="3341730" d="2310">proving that things
are the running time,</p>
<p t="3344040" d="6273">or the size is O of some
function of the input size.</p>
<p t="3350313" d="499">All right.</p>
<p t="3353780" d="1560">Any questions?</p>
<p t="3355340" d="505">Yeah.</p>
<p t="3355845" d="875">AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p t="3365484" d="666">PROFESSOR: Yeah.</p>
<p t="3366150" d="2430">It gets all dicey if you
do oscillatory things.</p>
<p t="3368580" d="1770">And it depends
how you define it.</p>
<p t="3370350" d="3010">So we're going to
stay away from that</p>
<p t="3373360" d="2370">and just stick with
this definition.</p>
<p t="3375730" d="2550">So if this guy
oscillates-- like f</p>
<p t="3378280" d="3380">is a sine of x,
sine of x is O of x.</p>
<p t="3381660" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="3382160" d="1900">It doesn't have to converge.</p>
<p t="3384060" d="3320">But as long as the ratio
is less than infinity.</p>
<p t="3387380" d="2064">AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p t="3389444" d="666">PROFESSOR: Yeah.</p>
<p t="3390110" d="1390">Everything you do.</p>
<p t="3391500" d="1750">Maybe you'll see sine
functions sometimes.</p>
<p t="3393250" d="1458">But everything you
do in algorithms</p>
<p t="3394708" d="1642">is going to be
growing monotonically.</p>
<p t="3396350" d="500">Yeah.</p>
<p t="3396850" d="3810">Nothing-- no wacky
stuff in math usually.</p>
<p t="3400660" d="2130">Any other questions?</p>
<p t="3402790" d="765">Yeah.</p>
<p t="3403555" d="2425">AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
sort of comparing</p>
<p t="3405980" d="2910">something that's the same
magnitude that you go off</p>
<p t="3408890" d="894">into infinity.</p>
<p t="3409784" d="666">PROFESSOR: Yeah.</p>
<p t="3410450" d="1556">It's upper bounded.</p>
<p t="3412006" d="874">So it's not the same.</p>
<p t="3412880" d="1416">We'll get to the
same in a minute.</p>
<p t="3414296" d="1014">But it's upper bounded.</p>
<p t="3415310" d="3640">f is upper bounded by g
up to a fixed constant</p>
<p t="3418950" d="1870">as you go to infinity.</p>
<p t="3420820" d="4129">And all constants get
washed away by O. Yeah.</p>
<p t="3424949" d="875">AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p t="3428850" d="1990">PROFESSOR: Ah, why is this true?</p>
<p t="3430840" d="3080">Well technically we'd have
to go back to calculus</p>
<p t="3433920" d="2590">and use L'Hopital's rule
or something like that,</p>
<p t="3436510" d="4010">because this function
exponential grows a lot faster</p>
<p t="3440520" d="850">than x to the tenth.</p>
<p t="3441370" d="2250">So L'Hopital's rule is you
take the derivative of this</p>
<p t="3443620" d="1280">over the derivative of that.</p>
<p t="3444900" d="2950">Then you'd have x to the
ninth over e to the x.</p>
<p t="3447850" d="1930">You do it nine more times.</p>
<p t="3449780" d="3370">And you'd get 10
factorial over e to the x.</p>
<p t="3453150" d="1850">And that limit is zero.</p>
<p t="3455000" d="4150">So that's how you'd actually
do it using L'Hopital's rule.</p>
<p t="3459150" d="1090">Yep.</p>
<p t="3460240" d="2180">Any polynomial grows slower
than any exponential.</p>
<p t="3465380" d="710">All right.</p>
<p t="3466090" d="4850">Let's now do some examples
that can get you screwed up.</p>
<p t="3473800" d="2990">What about this one?</p>
<p t="3476790" d="4521">Is 4 to the x O to 2 to the x?</p>
<p t="3486900" d="3280">Is that true?</p>
<p t="3490180" d="1650">No, it's not true.</p>
<p t="3491830" d="1880">I mean, the mistake
you might make</p>
<p t="3493710" d="3230">is say, oh, 4 and 2,
4 is only double 2.</p>
<p t="3496940" d="1810">Big O wipes out
constant factors.</p>
<p t="3498750" d="1610">So the answer is yes.</p>
<p t="3500360" d="1380">That would be bad.</p>
<p t="3501740" d="3030">Better to look at the limit.</p>
<p t="3504770" d="2990">So we'll state the correct
theorem-- 4 to the x</p>
<p t="3507760" d="3210">is not O of 2 to the x.</p>
<p t="3510970" d="4620">And the proof is obtained
by looking at the limit</p>
<p t="3515590" d="4470">as x goes to infinity of 4
to the x over 2 to the x.</p>
<p t="3520060" d="3600">That is just the limit 4
to the x over 2 to the x</p>
<p t="3523660" d="1340">is 2 to the x.</p>
<p t="3525000" d="2730">That's infinity.</p>
<p t="3527730" d="1826">So the limit is not bounded.</p>
<p t="3529556" d="954">All right?</p>
<p t="3530510" d="3191">So it is not big O there.</p>
<p t="3533701" d="679">All right.</p>
<p t="3534380" d="680">Here is one.</p>
<p t="3537770" d="2500">Is 10 O of 1?</p>
<p t="3545230" d="3560">I've purposely
written it this way.</p>
<p t="3548790" d="2150">Yes, it is.</p>
<p t="3550940" d="2830">And in fact the
interpretation here</p>
<p t="3553770" d="1800">is that you've got
some function f</p>
<p t="3555570" d="2740">of x that's just
always equal to 10,</p>
<p t="3558310" d="4240">and some function g of x
that's always equal to 1.</p>
<p t="3562550" d="3520">And then it is true in this
case that f of x is O of g of x.</p>
<p t="3568851" d="499">All right.</p>
<p t="3569350" d="6670">But any constant function is O
of any other constant function.</p>
<p t="3576020" d="1670">We're going to revisit
this in a nastier</p>
<p t="3577690" d="3205">scenario in a little bit.</p>
<p t="3580895" d="500">OK.</p>
<p t="3585490" d="5180">Sometimes you'll see
notation like this.</p>
<p t="3590670" d="3220">H of n-- in fact, we
saw this earlier--</p>
<p t="3593890" d="6880">is the log of n plus
delta plus O of 1 over n.</p>
<p t="3600770" d="3540">When we wrote out the formula
for the n'th harmonic number,</p>
<p t="3604310" d="3950">it was log of n plus
Euler's constant plus</p>
<p t="3608260" d="2940">something like 1 over n,
constant times 1 over n.</p>
<p t="3611200" d="2550">And then some even
smaller terms.</p>
<p t="3613750" d="1640">And so people will
write it like this.</p>
<p t="3615390" d="4450">And it tells you that the
error terms grow no faster</p>
<p t="3619840" d="2420">than a constant times 1 over n.</p>
<p t="3622260" d="3140">Technically this is the
wrong way to write it.</p>
<p t="3625400" d="3860">But everybody does
it, so you can too.</p>
<p t="3629260" d="2060">What it means is this.</p>
<p t="3631320" d="5561">H of n minus ln of n minus
delta is O of 1 over n.</p>
<p t="3636881" d="499">All right.</p>
<p t="3637380" d="2670">That's the correct
way to write it,</p>
<p t="3640050" d="3740">because you're taking the
ratio of this over that.</p>
<p t="3643790" d="1750">This is how people will do it.</p>
<p t="3645540" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="3646040" d="4220">So just make sure you
understand that, what it means</p>
<p t="3650260" d="1810">when you put it over there.</p>
<p t="3652070" d="2080">Same thing with tilde notation.</p>
<p t="3654150" d="6080">People will write this-- H of
n is tilde ln of n plus Euler's</p>
<p t="3660230" d="1130">constant.</p>
<p t="3661360" d="4000">The right way to write it
is Hn minus Euler's constant</p>
<p t="3665360" d="3360">is tilde ln of n.</p>
<p t="3668720" d="4470">Now can anybody tell me
why this is really not</p>
<p t="3673190" d="1380">a good thing to do?</p>
<p t="3674570" d="1750">And you think of how
things get really</p>
<p t="3676320" d="4676">screwed up if you allow
to start doing this?</p>
<p t="3680996" d="1374">Can you think of
anything that--?</p>
<p t="3685489" d="791">What if I did this?</p>
<p t="3686280" d="813">Is this true?</p>
<p t="3691431" d="499">10.</p>
<p t="3695070" d="2330">The n'th harmonic
is harmonic number</p>
<p t="3697400" d="3780">is tilde of log of n plus 10.</p>
<p t="3701180" d="580">Is that true?</p>
<p t="3704280" d="1770">Think about that.</p>
<p t="3706050" d="2197">People are shaking their heads.</p>
<p t="3708247" d="1083">I mean how can it be true?</p>
<p t="3709330" d="1760">Because we know this is.</p>
<p t="3711090" d="2610">We know that's what it is.</p>
<p t="3713700" d="2030">In fact, this is true.</p>
<p t="3715730" d="3270">I can even make it a million.</p>
<p t="3719000" d="1470">10 to the sixth here.</p>
<p t="3720470" d="2060">It's true.</p>
<p t="3722530" d="6030">Because the ratio of this over
that in the limit is what?</p>
<p t="3731160" d="1200">1.</p>
<p t="3732360" d="3731">And that's all I need for tilde.</p>
<p t="3736091" d="499">All right.</p>
<p t="3736590" d="5140">So when I wrote this,
everybody knew what I meant.</p>
<p t="3741730" d="3230">But I could write this and be
just as true mathematically.</p>
<p t="3744960" d="2680">And so you've got to be
sort of careful about this.</p>
<p t="3747640" d="2200">Really, the right
way to do it is this,</p>
<p t="3749840" d="2040">because now we're
taking off that term,</p>
<p t="3751880" d="1940">and then it's-- actually
I did this wrong.</p>
<p t="3753820" d="1040">I should've put the [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p t="3754860" d="340">Whoops.</p>
<p t="3755200" d="1208">I should've done it this way.</p>
<p t="3756408" d="1082">Let me rewrite that.</p>
<p t="3757490" d="3220">The right way to do it is
H of n-- yeah-- is this.</p>
<p t="3760710" d="1850">You put the small
term out over here.</p>
<p t="3762560" d="1180">That's the right way.</p>
<p t="3763740" d="2640">Because now it's not true
that it's 10 to the sixth out</p>
<p t="3766380" d="5670">here-- all right-- for the
ratio of that over this guy.</p>
<p t="3772050" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="3772550" d="1190">So you can do it.</p>
<p t="3773740" d="2010">But be careful,
because you might</p>
<p t="3775750" d="2040">write wrong things
that technically</p>
<p t="3777790" d="1610">would fit the definition.</p>
<p t="3779400" d="3640">Same thing with big
O. Same problem there.</p>
<p t="3783040" d="3325">Any questions about that?</p>
<p t="3790160" d="1920">All right.</p>
<p t="3792080" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="3792580" d="5200">Now one thing that people do all
the time that you cannot do is</p>
<p t="3797780" d="2352">to use big O as a lower bound.</p>
<p t="3802760" d="610">All right.</p>
<p t="3803370" d="3340">So that's one abuse that we
won't-- you'll get marked wrong</p>
<p t="3806710" d="4670">for doing that, even though
famous researchers will do it,</p>
<p t="3811380" d="2374">and you'll probably even have
a professor do it sometime.</p>
<p t="3817280" d="2480">So you may not do this.</p>
<p t="3819760" d="4510">f of x is bigger than
or equal to O of g of x.</p>
<p t="3824270" d="853">That is meaningless.</p>
<p t="3830180" d="4260">Because the whole point of big
O is that it's an upper bound.</p>
<p t="3834440" d="2790">So you can't use it
as a lower bound.</p>
<p t="3837230" d="1440">And the reason
you can't do it is</p>
<p t="3838670" d="5150">because there is another symbol
to do what you want to do.</p>
<p t="3843820" d="4140">And that's called
the omega symbol.</p>
<p t="3847960" d="1535">And it's written like this.</p>
<p t="3852380" d="3430">It's a capital omega.</p>
<p t="3855810" d="8210">And it's if the limit as x goes
to infinity of f of x over g</p>
<p t="3864020" d="4620">of x is greater than zero.</p>
<p t="3868640" d="570">OK.</p>
<p t="3869210" d="2290">So now we're getting
the lower bound version.</p>
<p t="3871500" d="5855">In fact it's just the
opposite of big O.</p>
<p t="3877355" d="1725">In fact, we'll state a theorem.</p>
<p t="3879080" d="980">Not hard to prove.</p>
<p t="3880060" d="1740">We won't do it.</p>
<p t="3881800" d="8410">f of x equals O of g of
x if and only if g of x</p>
<p t="3890210" d="3910">equals big omega of f of x.</p>
<p t="3897370" d="3910">In other words, f
grows no faster than g</p>
<p t="3901280" d="5310">if and only if g grows
at least as fast as f.</p>
<p t="3906590" d="1050">One's an upper bound one.</p>
<p t="3907640" d="1370">One's a lower bound.</p>
<p t="3909010" d="2420">And you've just got to use
the symbol the right way.</p>
<p t="3911430" d="1640">Now you can do this.</p>
<p t="3913070" d="6550">You can write f of x bigger
than or equal to omega g of x.</p>
<p t="3919620" d="2130">That's OK.</p>
<p t="3921750" d="500">All right?</p>
<p t="3922250" d="1880">That's all right to do.</p>
<p t="3924130" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="3924630" d="958">Let's do some examples.</p>
<p t="3929910" d="6450">So x squared is omega of x,
because it grows faster than x.</p>
<p t="3936360" d="3550">2 to the x is
omega of x squared.</p>
<p t="3954200" d="1760">All right.</p>
<p t="3955960" d="10300">x over 100 is omega
of 100x plus 25,</p>
<p t="3966260" d="2320">because constants don't matter.</p>
<p t="3968580" d="2390">x over 100 grows
at least as fast</p>
<p t="3970970" d="3970">as 100x does in terms, because
we're measuring the growth.</p>
<p t="3974940" d="2730">So constants go away.</p>
<p t="3977670" d="3160">If you want to say the
running time of that algorithm</p>
<p t="3980830" d="4760">is at least quadratic,
you would write T of n</p>
<p t="3985590" d="2912">is omega n squared.</p>
<p t="3988502" d="688">All right.</p>
<p t="3989190" d="4120">And that says that the running
time is at least n squared.</p>
<p t="3993310" d="4260">Any questions on big omega?</p>
<p t="3997570" d="4810">Not too hard once you have
big O. It's just the opposite.</p>
<p t="4002380" d="4510">All right the next
symbol is the version</p>
<p t="4006890" d="2130">of equality, where you're
bigger-- at least as big</p>
<p t="4009020" d="2220">as, and at most as big as.</p>
<p t="4011240" d="3940">There's a special
symbol for that.</p>
<p t="4015180" d="1405">So in that case we use theta.</p>
<p t="4022160" d="4050">And we say that f
of x equals theta</p>
<p t="4026210" d="8920">of g of x if the limit
is both bigger than 0</p>
<p t="4035130" d="4150">and less than infinity.</p>
<p t="4039280" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="4039780" d="4620">So it's just a shorthand way
of saying big O and big omega.</p>
<p t="4044400" d="1000">That's what theta means.</p>
<p t="4045400" d="3320">It just both hold true.</p>
<p t="4048720" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="4049220" d="2210">And that's a theorem which
is not hard to prove,</p>
<p t="4051430" d="1560">but we won't do it.</p>
<p t="4052990" d="8290">f of x equals theta of g
of x if and only f of the x</p>
<p t="4061280" d="8490">equals O of g of x and f
of x equals omega g of x.</p>
<p t="4073130" d="520">All right.</p>
<p t="4073650" d="2195">So let's do some
examples of theta.</p>
<p t="4089710" d="8970">So for example, 10x cubed
minus 20x plus 1 is more easily</p>
<p t="4098680" d="5660">written as theta of x cubed--
because the constants don't</p>
<p t="4104340" d="500">matter.</p>
<p t="4104840" d="2479">The low order
terms don't matter.</p>
<p t="4107319" d="1540">What about this?</p>
<p t="4108859" d="5601">Is x over log of x,
is that theta of x?</p>
<p t="4117400" d="1360">x over log of x.</p>
<p t="4118760" d="2740">Is that theta of x?</p>
<p t="4121500" d="3479">People are nodding their heads.</p>
<p t="4124979" d="1901">Hmm.</p>
<p t="4126880" d="870">Let's see.</p>
<p t="4127750" d="569">Let's check.</p>
<p t="4131859" d="5701">The limit as x goes to
infinity of x over log</p>
<p t="4137560" d="4100">of x divided by x.</p>
<p t="4141660" d="1260">Well, the x's cancel.</p>
<p t="4142920" d="8320">That's the limit as x goes to
infinity of 1 over log of x.</p>
<p t="4151240" d="2159">What's that?</p>
<p t="4153399" d="2061">0.</p>
<p t="4155460" d="1180">Uh-oh.</p>
<p t="4156640" d="2190">it is not theta.</p>
<p t="4158830" d="3470">I got to be bigger than zero.</p>
<p t="4162300" d="5580">In fact, this grows
more slowly than that--</p>
<p t="4167880" d="2370">strictly more slowly.</p>
<p t="4170250" d="1680">All right.</p>
<p t="4171930" d="4090">A little more slowly,
but strictly more slowly.</p>
<p t="4176020" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="4176520" d="3209">If I use for an
algorithm, if you</p>
<p t="4179729" d="3951">want to say the algorithm runs
in quadratic time-- namely</p>
<p t="4183680" d="2420">at least quadratic time, and
at most quadratic time-- then</p>
<p t="4186100" d="5066">you'd say t of n is
theta of n squared.</p>
<p t="4191166" d="1126">So let me write that.</p>
<p t="4195190" d="9370">So t of n equals theta
n squared means t grows</p>
<p t="4204560" d="9534">quadratically in n-- both
upper and lower bound.</p>
<p t="4214094" d="962">OK?</p>
<p t="4215056" d="12634">So for these three guys,
to summarize-- sort of you</p>
<p t="4227690" d="11380">can keep track of them pretty
simply-- O means less than</p>
<p t="4239070" d="960">or equal.</p>
<p t="4240030" d="3542">Omega means greater
than or equal.</p>
<p t="4243572" d="3626">Theta means equal up
to constant factors.</p>
<p t="4255870" d="3130">Now there's two
more symbols here.</p>
<p t="4259000" d="4622">And they correspond very
naturally to this set-up.</p>
<p t="4263622" d="2208">What two symbols are missing
from here that would you</p>
<p t="4265830" d="2820">naturally add to here?</p>
<p t="4268650" d="500">Yeah.</p>
<p t="4269150" d="1980">Less than and greater than.</p>
<p t="4271130" d="4490">So less than is little o.</p>
<p t="4275620" d="3810">Greater than is little omega.</p>
<p t="4279430" d="5280">And less than means it's less
than or equal, but not equal.</p>
<p t="4284710" d="3566">And this means greater
than or equal, not equal.</p>
<p t="4288276" d="1874">And let me put them up
over here and give you</p>
<p t="4290150" d="958">the formal definitions.</p>
<p t="4294852" d="500">Eraser.</p>
<p t="4312240" d="500">OK.</p>
<p t="4312740" d="2380">So little o.</p>
<p t="4320770" d="3510">as we have f of x
equals little o of g</p>
<p t="4324280" d="14030">x if the limit of f of
x over g of x equals 0.</p>
<p t="4338310" d="2500">So f is growing
strictly smaller than g,</p>
<p t="4340810" d="3870">so that when I take the
ratio, the limit goes to 0.</p>
<p t="4344680" d="1797">And the reverse is little omega.</p>
<p t="4350860" d="5020">And we say that f of x is
little omega-- whoops--</p>
<p t="4355880" d="6890">of g of x if this is infinity.</p>
<p t="4362770" d="3660">Because now f is growing
strictly faster than g,</p>
<p t="4366430" d="4680">so I take the limit of the
ratio, and it goes to infinity.</p>
<p t="4371110" d="4284">All right so we can do
some simple examples.</p>
<p t="4375394" d="1916">Then we're almost done
with all this notation.</p>
<p t="4389520" d="1160">What about this one?</p>
<p t="4390680" d="6029">x over ln of x-- we just
looked at it-- and x.</p>
<p t="4396709" d="1467">What symbol do I put there?</p>
<p t="4401600" d="3270">What symbol's missing here?</p>
<p t="4404870" d="1190">Little o.</p>
<p t="4406060" d="1830">This grows strictly
smaller than that.</p>
<p t="4407890" d="3500">If I took the ratio, and I
took the limit, we got 0.</p>
<p t="4411390" d="2120">So that's a little o.</p>
<p t="4413510" d="2300">OK.</p>
<p t="4415810" d="1530">Is this true?</p>
<p t="4417340" d="3087">x over 100-- is
that little o of x?</p>
<p t="4424050" d="2360">No.</p>
<p t="4426410" d="2110">The limit of the
ratio is 1 over 100.</p>
<p t="4428520" d="1070">That's bigger than 0.</p>
<p t="4429590" d="1680">Constants don't matter.</p>
<p t="4431270" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="4431770" d="2760">So what symbol would go here?</p>
<p t="4434530" d="1530">Theta goes here.</p>
<p t="4436060" d="900">Good.</p>
<p t="4436960" d="1350">Also big O and big omega.</p>
<p t="4438310" d="3001">But theta captures everything.</p>
<p t="4441311" d="499">All right.</p>
<p t="4441810" d="2180">What symbol goes here?</p>
<p t="4443990" d="4340">x squared equals something x.</p>
<p t="4448330" d="3330">What symbol goes there?</p>
<p t="4451660" d="975">Little omega.</p>
<p t="4452635" d="1625">It would also be true
to put big omega,</p>
<p t="4454260" d="2060">but little omega tells you more.</p>
<p t="4456320" d="4701">Because the limit of x squared
over x goes to infinity.</p>
<p t="4461021" d="499">OK.</p>
<p t="4461520" d="3240">Any questions
about these things?</p>
<p t="4464760" d="3930">So a natural thing on the
midterm is we do some of that,</p>
<p t="4468690" d="1020">for example.</p>
<p t="4469710" d="700">All right?</p>
<p t="4470410" d="2630">And you'll certainly see
some of that on homework.</p>
<p t="4473040" d="2480">You might see some
of that on the test.</p>
<p t="4475520" d="2170">You'll certainly see all
this stuff-- little omega</p>
<p t="4477690" d="3330">not very often in 6046 and
later algorithms courses.</p>
<p t="4481020" d="2950">But all the rest
you'll see there.</p>
<p t="4483970" d="2260">Any questions?</p>
<p t="4486230" d="630">All right.</p>
<p t="4486860" d="2900">Now I'm going to
show you something</p>
<p t="4489760" d="2260">that is sort of scary.</p>
<p t="4492020" d="542">Yeah.</p>
<p t="4492562" d="1416">AUDIENCE: Why do
you say that it's</p>
<p t="4493978" d="1693">equal to zero when
you said it's less</p>
<p t="4495671" d="5779">than [INAUDIBLE] equals sign.</p>
<p t="4501450" d="1370">PROFESSOR: Which equals?</p>
<p t="4502820" d="2760">AUDIENCE: You said little
omega is less than.</p>
<p t="4505580" d="2716">PROFESSOR: Little omega,
it corresponds to a greater</p>
<p t="4508296" d="3354">than, which means a
greater than or equal to,</p>
<p t="4511650" d="3190">but not an equal to.</p>
<p t="4514840" d="2670">And the way we can see that
is looking at the definitions</p>
<p t="4517510" d="8195">here in the greater than or
equal to is the big omega.</p>
<p t="4525705" d="6145">And that just says
you're bigger than 0.</p>
<p t="4531850" d="500">Ah.</p>
<p t="4532350" d="930">Let's see.</p>
<p t="4533280" d="2070">All right.</p>
<p t="4535350" d="2330">So I'm bigger than
or equal to is omega.</p>
<p t="4537680" d="5290">But I'm not equal
to, which is theta.</p>
<p t="4542970" d="3970">So if I know that I'm
this but not that,</p>
<p t="4546940" d="4520">the only conclusion is that
I'm infinity in the ratio.</p>
<p t="4551460" d="500">All right?</p>
<p t="4551960" d="1930">So that's another
way of saying it.</p>
<p t="4553890" d="2050">That's why.</p>
<p t="4555940" d="982">Any other questions?</p>
<p t="4560090" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="4560590" d="1458">Now I'm going to
show you something</p>
<p t="4562048" d="3372">that is commonly done, and
that many students will attempt</p>
<p t="4565420" d="1717">to do after seeing
this notation,</p>
<p t="4567137" d="1583">because the notation
is pretty simple.</p>
<p t="4568720" d="708">Take your limits.</p>
<p t="4569428" d="1472">Everything goes fine.</p>
<p t="4570900" d="2390">Then you start
cruising along with it.</p>
<p t="4573290" d="2200">So now I'm going to show
you how to prove something</p>
<p t="4575490" d="6280">that's false using this notation
in a way that people often do.</p>
<p t="4581770" d="4930">And the hope is by showing
you, you won't do it.</p>
<p t="4586700" d="4390">It will confuse you,
which is why sometimes we</p>
<p t="4591090" d="1390">worry about showing you.</p>
<p t="4592480" d="15940">But let f of i-- f of n-- equal
the sum i equals 1 to n of i.</p>
<p t="4608420" d="3180">Now we all know
what that is, right?</p>
<p t="4611600" d="1100">All right.</p>
<p t="4612700" d="6756">So I'm going to prove to
you that f of n is O of n.</p>
<p t="4622310" d="4150">Now what really-- what
should be here instead of n?</p>
<p t="4626460" d="1520">n squared.</p>
<p t="4627980" d="2110">So n squared can't be O of n.</p>
<p t="4630090" d="1910">So this can't be true.</p>
<p t="4632000" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="4632500" d="2630">Well let's see how we do it.</p>
<p t="4637570" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="4638070" d="13210">So the false proof
is by induction on n.</p>
<p t="4651280" d="8540">My induction hypothesis is p
of n is going to be that f of n</p>
<p t="4659820" d="2090">is O of n.</p>
<p t="4661910" d="500">All right?</p>
<p t="4662410" d="2610">That's what we, when we want to
prove something by induction,</p>
<p t="4665020" d="1460">typically that's what you do.</p>
<p t="4666480" d="2885">Becomes the
induction hypothesis.</p>
<p t="4669365" d="1166">Let's look at the base case.</p>
<p t="4674690" d="8322">Well f of 1 is 1, and
1 is O of 1 surely.</p>
<p t="4683012" d="838">Right?</p>
<p t="4683850" d="3140">Even 10 was O of 1.</p>
<p t="4686990" d="500">OK.</p>
<p t="4699420" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="4699920" d="1506">Now we do the inductive step.</p>
<p t="4708030" d="8375">We assume p n is true to
prove that p n plus 1 is true.</p>
<p t="4719260" d="7590">Well p n means that
f of n is O of n.</p>
<p t="4726850" d="3130">Now I look at f of n plus 1.</p>
<p t="4729980" d="3650">That equals the sum of
the first n plus 1 number.</p>
<p t="4733630" d="6010">So that will be f
of n plus n plus 1.</p>
<p t="4739640" d="4360">The induction hypothesis
says this is O of n.</p>
<p t="4744000" d="1620">Clearly this is O of n.</p>
<p t="4748720" d="2110">Well I got O of n plus O of n.</p>
<p t="4750830" d="1555">That's at most twice O of n.</p>
<p t="4756490" d="2140">And constants don't matter.</p>
<p t="4758630" d="1491">So that's O of n.</p>
<p t="4766020" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="4766520" d="5160">This should begin
to cause panic.</p>
<p t="4771680" d="1220">Is induction wrong?</p>
<p t="4772900" d="2620">What's going on with the big O?</p>
<p t="4775520" d="1830">You will see this
done all the time.</p>
<p t="4777350" d="3640">People would do this
kind of an argument.</p>
<p t="4780990" d="3440">Looks pretty good, right?</p>
<p t="4784430" d="3926">Can anybody see where
I got off track?</p>
<p t="4788356" d="1624">This is a really hard
one to figure out</p>
<p t="4789980" d="1330">where things went wrong.</p>
<p t="4791310" d="944">Yeah?</p>
<p t="4792254" d="1652">AUDIENCE: One of them
might be that you</p>
<p t="4793906" d="6552">might be applying O of n
to numbers which really you</p>
<p t="4800458" d="4582">really apply asymptotic
notation to functions.</p>
<p t="4805040" d="1350">PROFESSOR: Great.</p>
<p t="4806390" d="1670">That's a great observation.</p>
<p t="4808060" d="3640">Asymptotic notation only
works for functions.</p>
<p t="4811700" d="3760">Now here when we
say 1 is O of 1,</p>
<p t="4815460" d="4140">well, you could think of it as
f of x being 1-- the function--</p>
<p t="4819600" d="640">and so forth.</p>
<p t="4820240" d="1240">So that's OK.</p>
<p t="4821480" d="1250">That's a great point.</p>
<p t="4822730" d="4269">Now let's figure out using
that how we got in trouble.</p>
<p t="4826999" d="1041">We're not quite done yet.</p>
<p t="4828040" d="1630">That's a great observation.</p>
<p t="4829670" d="2490">But where's the
step that's wrong?</p>
<p t="4835870" d="720">Oh, no.</p>
<p t="4836590" d="2160">2 times O of n is O of n.</p>
<p t="4838750" d="4440">If I have a function that's f
is O of g, twice f is O of g.</p>
<p t="4843190" d="888">Yeah?</p>
<p t="4844078" d="3674">AUDIENCE: It's the end of
n equals 1 [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p t="4847752" d="708">PROFESSOR: Is it?</p>
<p t="4848460" d="1911">So what's the problem now?</p>
<p t="4850371" d="2459">AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p t="4852830" d="3270">PROFESSOR: Well f of n plus
1-- this statement is true,</p>
<p t="4856100" d="7300">because f of n plus 1 is the sum
of i equals 1 to n plus 1 of i.</p>
<p t="4863400" d="3960">That's 1 plus 2 plus
n plus n plus 1.</p>
<p t="4867360" d="3270">And this is f of n.</p>
<p t="4870630" d="902">So that's OK.</p>
<p t="4879010" d="960">Yeah.</p>
<p t="4879970" d="4434">AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
that function.</p>
<p t="4884404" d="666">PROFESSOR: Yeah.</p>
<p t="4885070" d="3750">You know, you're getting closer.</p>
<p t="4888820" d="3920">Yeah that's a little
flaky, because I've just</p>
<p t="4892740" d="2210">got a single value
saying it's O of one.</p>
<p t="4894950" d="3170">But we sort of argued
before that 10 was O of 1.</p>
<p t="4898120" d="2642">Now realize a function
behind here that matters.</p>
<p t="4900762" d="1208">So you're on the right trail.</p>
<p t="4901970" d="2190">But there's an even
bigger whopper hiding.</p>
<p t="4904160" d="824">Yeah.</p>
<p t="4904984" d="1175">AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p t="4906159" d="791">PROFESSOR: Oh yeah.</p>
<p t="4906950" d="4180">This is really, really bad.</p>
<p t="4911130" d="1390">All right.</p>
<p t="4912520" d="4250">So now explain to me why this
is really bad what I did here.</p>
<p t="4916770" d="3134">AUDIENCE: You didn't need
the function [INAUDIBLE].</p>
<p t="4919904" d="666">PROFESSOR: Yeah.</p>
<p t="4920570" d="2270">And why isn't-- this
looks like a function.</p>
<p t="4922840" d="1098">Why isn't it a function?</p>
<p t="4927010" d="730">It's not.</p>
<p t="4927740" d="1710">But it looks like one.</p>
<p t="4929450" d="1310">f of n sure looks like one.</p>
<p t="4930760" d="3368">Why is it not a function when
it's sitting in this thing?</p>
<p t="4936870" d="2860">This P of n, right?</p>
<p t="4939730" d="3620">Because I've fixed
the value of n here.</p>
<p t="4943350" d="2520">And so this is
now just a scalar.</p>
<p t="4945870" d="8150">In fact, you know, I could state
the following-- f of a million,</p>
<p t="4954020" d="4910">right, is O of 1, because
this is really some function H</p>
<p t="4958930" d="3000">of x that always is this value.</p>
<p t="4961930" d="2540">So the difference between
a scalar and a function.</p>
<p t="4964470" d="3240">And this is just so nasty
looking, because we see f of n.</p>
<p t="4967710" d="1430">That's a function.</p>
<p t="4969140" d="5851">But you can never use
big O in a predicate,</p>
<p t="4974991" d="1999">all right, because we've
lost the function here.</p>
<p t="4976990" d="3700">This is just f
valued at n period.</p>
<p t="4980690" d="2740">That single instance is
all that's happened here.</p>
<p t="4983430" d="2480">It's not a function anymore.</p>
<p t="4985910" d="880">All right.</p>
<p t="4986790" d="2690">If we had f n of x or
something, that might be OK.</p>
<p t="4989480" d="2060">But there's no function left.</p>
<p t="4991540" d="500">All right.</p>
<p t="4992040" d="5630">So never ever use asymptotic
notation with inductive proofs,</p>
<p t="4997670" d="2570">because you will
just invariably stick</p>
<p t="5000240" d="2910">big O into your predicate.</p>
<p t="5003150" d="4040">And you could prove all sorts of
false things once you do that.</p>
<p t="5007190" d="2400">OK?</p>
<p t="5009590" d="560">All right.</p>
<p t="5010150" d="3250">Never use asymptotic notation
in induction or predicates.</p>
<p t="5013400" d="1550">Thanks.</p>
