<p t="7000" d="5619">I assume from high school you
know how to add and multiply</p>
<p t="12619" d="4930">complex numbers using the
relation i squared equals</p>
<p t="17549" d="5521">negative one.
I'm a little less certain that</p>
<p t="23070" d="6014">you remember how to divide them.
I hope you read last night by</p>
<p t="29084" d="5324">way of preparation for that,
but since that's something</p>
<p t="34408" d="5817">we're going to have to do a lot
of a differential equations,</p>
<p t="40225" d="5620">so remember that the division
is done by making use of the</p>
<p t="45845" d="5108">complex conjugate.
So, if z is equal to a plus bi,</p>
<p t="50953" d="2995">some people write a plus ib,</p>
<p t="53948" d="3256">and sometimes I'll do
that too if it's more</p>
<p t="57204" d="2670">convenient.
Then, the complex conjugate is</p>
<p t="59874" d="3126">what you get by changing i to
negative i.</p>
<p t="63000" d="3792">And, the important thing is
that the product of those two is</p>
<p t="66792" d="2507">a real number.
The product of these is a</p>
<p t="69299" d="3858">squared minus the quantity ib
all squared,</p>
<p t="73157" d="3793">which makes a squared plus b
squared because i</p>
<p t="76950" d="2314">squared is negative one.</p>
<p t="79264" d="3600">So, the product of those,
that's what you multiply if you</p>
<p t="82864" d="3214">want to multiply this by
something to make it real.</p>
<p t="86078" d="3922">You always multiplied by its
complex conjugate.</p>
<p t="90000" d="4089">And that's the trick that
underlines the doing of the</p>
<p t="94089" d="1967">division.
So, for example,</p>
<p t="96056" d="4247">I better hang onto these or
I'll never remember all the</p>
<p t="100303" d="2359">examples.
Suppose, for example,</p>
<p t="102662" d="4562">we wanted to calculate (two
plus i) divided by (one minus 3</p>
<p t="107224" d="4483">i).
To calculate it means I want to</p>
<p t="111707" d="3697">do the division;
I want to express the answer in</p>
<p t="115404" d="5076">the form a plus bi.
What you do is multiply the top</p>
<p t="120480" d="4479">and bottom by the complex
conjugate of the denominator in</p>
<p t="124959" d="4161">order to make it real.
So, it's (one plus 3i) divided</p>
<p t="129120" d="4960">by (one plus 3i),
as they taught you in</p>
<p t="134080" d="2399">elementary school,
that is one,</p>
<p t="136479" d="4400">in a rather odd notation;
therefore, multiplying doesn't</p>
<p t="140879" d="2560">change the value of the
fraction.</p>
<p t="143439" d="4081">And so, the denominator now
becomes 1 squared plus 3</p>
<p t="147520" d="4480">squared, which is ten.</p>
<p t="152000" d="3723">And, the numerator is,
learn to do this without</p>
<p t="155723" d="4615">multiplying out four terms.
You must be able to do this in</p>
<p t="160338" d="3076">your head.
And, you always do it by the</p>
<p t="163414" d="4938">grouping, or post office method,
whatever you want to call it,</p>
<p t="168352" d="4938">namely, first put down the real
part, which is made out of two</p>
<p t="173290" d="4533">times one minus three times one.
So, that's negative one.</p>
<p t="177823" d="4048">And then, the imaginary part,
which is i times one.</p>
<p t="181871" d="4129">That's one, coefficient one,
plus 6i.</p>
<p t="186000" d="3396">So, that makes 7i.
Now, some people feel this</p>
<p t="189396" d="2856">still doesn't look right,
if you wish,</p>
<p t="192252" d="3551">and for some places and
differential equations,</p>
<p t="195803" d="4632">it will be useful to write that
as minus one tenth plus seven</p>
<p t="200435" d="4322">tenths i.
And, now it's perfectly clear</p>
<p t="204757" d="5419">that it's in the form a plus bi.
So, learn to do that if you</p>
<p t="210176" d="3708">don't know already.
It's going to be important.</p>
<p t="213884" d="4272">Now, the main thing today is
the polar representation,</p>
<p t="218156" d="3870">which sometimes they don't get
to in high school.</p>
<p t="222026" d="3385">And if they do,
it's usually not in a grown</p>
<p t="225411" d="3789">up-enough in a form for us to be
able to use it.</p>
<p t="229200" d="3305">So, I have to worry about that
little bit.</p>
<p t="232505" d="4272">The polar representation,
of course, is nominally just</p>
<p t="236777" d="4192">the switch to polar coordinates.
If here's a plus bi,</p>
<p t="240969" d="4031">then this is r,
and that's theta.</p>
<p t="245000" d="2968">And therefore,
this can be written as,</p>
<p t="247968" d="3691">in the polar form,
that would be r cosine theta</p>
<p t="251659" d="3931">plus i, or r cosine theta.</p>
<p t="255590" d="2487">That's the A part.</p>
<p t="258077" d="3369">And, the B part is,
the imaginary part is r</p>
<p t="261446" d="2969">sin(theta) times i.</p>
<p t="264415" d="3289">Now, it would be customary,
at this point,</p>
<p t="267704" d="5296">to put the i in front,
just because it looks better.</p>
<p t="273000" d="3357">The complex numbers are
commutative, satisfied to</p>
<p t="276357" d="2308">commutative law of
multiplication,</p>
<p t="278665" d="4057">which means it doesn't matter
in multiplication whether you</p>
<p t="282722" d="3637">put i in front or behind.
It's still the same answer.</p>
<p t="286359" d="3986">So, this would be r cosine
theta plus i times </p>
<p t="290345" d="2309">r sine theta,</p>
<p t="292654" d="2308">which, of course,
will factor out,</p>
<p t="294962" d="4266">and will make it cosine theta
plus i sine theta.</p>
<p t="299228" d="3148">Now, it was Euler who took the</p>
<p t="302376" d="3567">decisive step and said,
hey, look, I'm going to call</p>
<p t="305943" d="4057">that e to the i theta.</p>
<p t="310000" d="5586">Now, why did he do that?
Because everything seemed to</p>
<p t="315586" d="5802">indicate that it should.
But that's certainly worth the</p>
<p t="321388" d="3545">best color we have,
which is what?</p>
<p t="324933" d="4513">We are getting low here.
Okay, nonetheless,</p>
<p t="329446" d="4834">it's worth pink.
I will even give him his due,</p>
<p t="334280" d="3904">Euler.
Sometimes it's called Euler's</p>
<p t="338184" d="2636">formula, but it really shouldn't
be.</p>
<p t="340820" d="2787">It's not a formula.
It's a definition.</p>
<p t="343607" d="3164">So, in some sense,
you can't argue with it.</p>
<p t="346771" d="4143">If you want to call putting a
complex number in a power,</p>
<p t="350914" d="2109">and calling it that,
you can.</p>
<p t="353023" d="3013">But, one can certainly ask why
he did it.</p>
<p t="356036" d="2938">And the answer,
I guess, is that all the</p>
<p t="358974" d="4519">evidence seemed to point to the
fact that it was the thing to</p>
<p t="363493" d="3731">do.
Now, I think it's important to</p>
<p t="367224" d="3263">talk about a little bit because
I think it's,</p>
<p t="370487" d="3189">in my opinion,
if you're seeing this for the</p>
<p t="373676" d="3559">first time, even if you read
about it last night,</p>
<p t="377235" d="3857">it's a mysterious thing,
and one needs to see it from</p>
<p t="381092" d="4449">every possible point of view.
It's something you get used to.</p>
<p t="385541" d="3708">You will never see it in a
sudden flash of insight.</p>
<p t="389249" d="4524">It will just get as familiar to
you as more common arithmetic,</p>
<p t="393773" d="4227">and algebraic,
and calculus processes are.</p>
<p t="398000" d="2583">But, look.
What is it we demand?</p>
<p t="400583" d="4000">If you're going to call
something an exponential,</p>
<p t="404583" d="3250">what is it we want an
exponential to do,</p>
<p t="407833" d="5083">what gives an expression like
this the right to be called e to</p>
<p t="412916" d="4584">the i theta?
The answer is I can't creep</p>
<p t="417500" d="4437">inside Euler's mind.
It must have been a very big</p>
<p t="421937" d="2837">day of his life.
He had a lot of big days,</p>
<p t="424774" d="4151">but when he realized that that
was the thing to write down as</p>
<p t="428925" d="3460">the definition of e to the i
theta.</p>
<p t="432385" d="2975">But, what is it one wants of an
exponential?</p>
<p t="435360" d="4152">Well, the high school answer
surely is you want it to satisfy</p>
<p t="439512" d="2560">the exponential law.
Now, to my shock,</p>
<p t="442072" d="2491">I realize a lot of people don't
know.</p>
<p t="444563" d="3321">In my analysis class,
these are some math majors,</p>
<p t="447884" d="2837">or graduate engineers in
various subjects,</p>
<p t="450721" d="4013">and if I say prove such and
such using the exponential law,</p>
<p t="454734" d="3806">I'm sure to get at least half a
dozen e-mails asking me,</p>
<p t="458540" d="6448">what's the exponential law?
Okay, the exponential law is a</p>
<p t="464988" d="6274">to the x times a to the y equals
a to the x plus y:</p>
<p t="471262" d="3287">the law of exponents.</p>
<p t="474549" d="5379">That's the most important
reason why, that's the single</p>
<p t="479928" d="5677">most important thing about
exponents, are the way one uses</p>
<p t="485605" d="4520">them.
And, this is the exponential</p>
<p t="490125" d="6363">function, called the exponential
function because all this</p>
<p t="496488" d="4130">significant stuff is in the
exponents.</p>
<p t="500618" d="4577">All right, so it should
satisfy-- we want,</p>
<p t="505195" d="5805">first of all,
the exponential law to be true.</p>
<p t="511000" d="3605">But that's not all.
That's a high school answer.</p>
<p t="514605" d="4066">An MIT answer would be,
I mean, why is e to the x such</p>
<p t="518671" d="2686">a popular function?
Well, of course,</p>
<p t="521357" d="3605">it does satisfy the exponential
law, but for us,</p>
<p t="524962" d="3683">an even more reasonable thing.
It's the function,</p>
<p t="528645" d="4526">which, when you differentiate
it, you get the same thing you</p>
<p t="533171" d="3376">started with.
And, it's apart from a constant</p>
<p t="536547" d="5742">factor, the only such function.
Now, in terms of differential</p>
<p t="542289" d="4421">equations, it means that it's
the solution that e to the,</p>
<p t="546710" d="4421">let's be a little generous,
make it e to the ax.</p>
<p t="551131" d="4500">No, better not to use x because
complex numbers tend to be</p>
<p t="555631" d="4500">called x plus iy.
Let's use t as a more neutral</p>
<p t="560131" d="3474">variable, which is standing
outside the fray,</p>
<p t="563605" d="3158">as it were.
It satisfies the relationship</p>
<p t="566763" d="2763">that it's the solution,
if you like,</p>
<p t="569526" d="5329">to the differential equation.
That's a fancy way of saying</p>
<p t="574855" d="2253">it.
dy / dt equals a times y.</p>
<p t="577108" d="1657">Now, of course,</p>
<p t="578765" d="2981">that is not unique.
We could make it unique by</p>
<p t="581746" d="3513">putting in an initial value.
So, if I want to get this</p>
<p t="585259" d="3843">function and not a constant
times it, I should make this an</p>
<p t="589102" d="3777">initial value problem and say
that y of zero should be one.</p>
<p t="592879" d="2717">And now, I will get only the</p>
<p t="595596" d="2717">function, e to the at.
So, in other words,</p>
<p t="598313" d="2120">that characterizes this
function.</p>
<p t="600433" d="3579">It's the only function in the
whole world that has that</p>
<p t="604012" d="4649">property.
Now, if you're going to call</p>
<p t="608661" d="4849">something e to the i theta,
we want that to be true.</p>
<p t="613510" d="4944">So, here are my questions.
Is it true that e to the i</p>
<p t="618454" d="4943">theta one, let's use that,
times e to the i theta two,</p>
<p t="623397" d="5895">see, I'm on a collision course</p>
<p t="629292" d="6055">here, but that's easily fixed.
Is that equal to e to the i</p>
<p t="635347" d="4609">(theta one plus theta two)?</p>
<p t="639956" d="3913">If that turns out to be so,
that's a big step.</p>
<p t="643869" d="2957">What would we like to be true
here?</p>
<p t="646826" d="5391">Well, will it be true that the
derivative, with respect to t of</p>
<p t="652217" d="4000">e to the i theta,
I would like that to be equal</p>
<p t="656217" d="4869">to i times e to the i theta.</p>
<p t="661086" d="3064">So, question,</p>
<p t="664150" d="3450">question.
I think those are the two most</p>
<p t="667600" d="3893">significant things.
Now, the nodes do a third</p>
<p t="671493" d="2919">thing, talk about infinite
series.</p>
<p t="674412" d="3982">Since we haven't done infinite
series, anyway,</p>
<p t="678394" d="5131">it's not officially part of the
syllabus, the kind of power</p>
<p t="683525" d="4954">series that are required.
But, I will put it down for the</p>
<p t="688479" d="3805">sake of completeness,
as people like to say.</p>
<p t="692284" d="7503">So, it should behave right.
The infinite series should be</p>
<p t="699787" d="4702">nice.
The infinite series should work</p>
<p t="704489" d="3919">out.
There is no word for this,</p>
<p t="708408" d="3396">should work out,
let's say.</p>
<p t="711804" d="4049">I mean, what's the little
music?</p>
<p t="715853" d="7967">Is that some weird music idea,
or is it only me that hears it?</p>
<p t="723820" d="4180">[LAUGHTER] Yes,
Lord.</p>
<p t="728000" d="3038">I feel I'm being watched up
there.</p>
<p t="731038" d="3406">This is terrible.
So, there's one guy.</p>
<p t="734444" d="4419">Here's another guy.
And, I won't put a box around</p>
<p t="738863" d="4235">the infinite series,
since I'm not going to say</p>
<p t="743098" d="3314">anything about it.
Now, these things,</p>
<p t="746412" d="4419">in fact, are both true.
Otherwise, why would I be</p>
<p t="750831" d="6169">saying them, and why would Euler
have made the formula?</p>
<p t="757000" d="4939">But, what's interesting to see
is what's behind them.</p>
<p t="761939" d="5129">And, that gives you little
practice also in calculating</p>
<p t="767068" d="4939">with the complex numbers.
So, let's look at the first</p>
<p t="772007" d="1995">one.
What will it say?</p>
<p t="774002" d="3990">It is asking the question.
It says, please,</p>
<p t="777992" d="3894">calculate the product of these
two things.</p>
<p t="781886" d="2185">Okay, I do it,
I'm told.</p>
<p t="784071" d="5794">I will calculate the product of
cosine theta one plus i cosine</p>
<p t="789865" d="4149">theta two-- Sine.
Sine theta one.</p>
<p t="794014" d="3313">That's e to the i</p>
<p t="797327" d="2231">theta one, right?</p>
<p t="799558" d="3719">So, that corresponds to this.
The other factor times the</p>
<p t="803277" d="2772">other factor,
cosine theta two plus i sine</p>
<p t="806049" d="2773">theta two.</p>
<p t="808822" d="3178">Okay, what does that come out
to be?</p>
<p t="812000" d="2524">Well, again,
we will use the method of</p>
<p t="814524" d="2457">grouping.
What's the real part of it?</p>
<p t="816981" d="3753">The real part of it is cosine
theta one cosine theta two.</p>
<p t="820734" d="3957">And then, there's a real part,</p>
<p t="824691" d="2320">which comes from these two
factors.</p>
<p t="827011" d="3617">It's going to occur with a
minus sign because of the i</p>
<p t="830628" d="2593">squared.
And, what's left is sine theta</p>
<p t="833221" d="3139">one sine theta two.</p>
<p t="836360" d="4640">And then, the imaginary part,
I'll factor out the i.</p>
<p t="841000" d="4661">And then, what's left,
I won't have to keep repeating</p>
<p t="845661" d="2958">the i.
So, it will have to be sine</p>
<p t="848619" d="4840">theta one cosine theta two.</p>
<p t="853459" d="5019">And, the other factor will be
cosine theta one sine theta</p>
<p t="858478" d="4034">two-- plus sine theta two cosine
theta one.</p>
<p t="862512" d="4751">Well, it looks like a mess,</p>
<p t="867263" d="3316">but, again, high school to the
rescue.</p>
<p t="870579" d="4946">What is this?
The top thing is nothing in</p>
<p t="875525" d="5611">disguise, but it's a disguised
form of cosine (theta one plus</p>
<p t="881136" d="3274">theta two).</p>
<p t="884410" d="4769">And the bottom is sine of
(theta one plus theta two).</p>
<p t="889179" d="4957">So, the product of these two</p>
<p t="894136" d="4302">things is this,
and that's exactly the formula.</p>
<p t="898438" d="3648">In other words,
this formula is a way of</p>
<p t="902086" d="5892">writing those two trigonometric
identities for the cosine of the</p>
<p t="907978" d="5853">sum and the sine of the sum.
Instead of the two identities</p>
<p t="913831" d="3411">taking up that much space,
written one after the other,</p>
<p t="917242" d="3536">they take up as much space,
and they say exactly the same</p>
<p t="920778" d="1832">thing.
Those two trigonometric</p>
<p t="922610" d="3916">identities are exactly the same
as saying that e to the i theta</p>
<p t="926526" d="3474">satisfies the
exponential law.</p>
<p t="930000" d="3469">Now, people ask,
you know, what's beautiful in</p>
<p t="933469" d="2776">mathematics?
To me, that's beautiful.</p>
<p t="936245" d="3547">I think that's great.
Something long turns into</p>
<p t="939792" d="2930">something short,
and it's just as good,</p>
<p t="942722" d="3239">and moreover,
connects with all these other</p>
<p t="945961" d="3316">things in the world,
differential equations,</p>
<p t="949277" d="2544">infinite series,
blah, blah, blah,</p>
<p t="951821" d="2853">blah, blah.
Okay, I don't have to sell</p>
<p t="954674" d="1774">Euler.
He sells himself.</p>
<p t="956448" d="5552">Now, how about the other one?
How about the other one?</p>
<p t="962000" d="7337">Now, that's obviously,
I haven't said something</p>
<p t="969337" d="7816">because for one thing,
how do you differentiate if</p>
<p t="977153" d="5742">there's theta here,
and t down there.</p>
<p t="982895" d="7375">Okay, that's easily fixed.
But, how do I differentiate</p>
<p t="990270" d="2943">this?
What kind of a guy is e to the</p>
<p t="993213" d="4037">i theta?
Well, if I write it out,</p>
<p t="997250" d="4625">take a look at what it is.
It's cosine theta plus i sine</p>
<p t="1001875" d="2943">theta.</p>
<p t="1004818" d="2691">As theta varies,
it's a function.</p>
<p t="1007509" d="3868">The variable is real.
Theta is a real variable.</p>
<p t="1011377" d="3868">Its angle in radians,
but it runs from negative</p>
<p t="1015245" d="4205">infinity to infinity.
So, if you think of functions</p>
<p t="1019450" d="3363">as a black box,
what's going in is a real</p>
<p t="1022813" d="4077">number.
But, what's coming out is a</p>
<p t="1026890" d="2310">complex number.
So, schematically,</p>
<p t="1029200" d="3359">here is the e to the i theta
box,</p>
<p t="1032559" d="3081">if you like to think that way,
theta goes in,</p>
<p t="1035640" d="2590">and that's real,
and a complex number,</p>
<p t="1038230" d="2730">this particular complex number
goes out.</p>
<p t="1040960" d="3430">So, one, we'd call it,
I'm not going to write this</p>
<p t="1044390" d="3639">down because it's sort of
pompous and takes too long.</p>
<p t="1048029" d="4971">But, it is a complex valued
function of a real variable.</p>
<p t="1053000" d="3243">You got that?
Up to now, we studied real</p>
<p t="1056243" d="4823">functions of real variables.
But now, real valued functions</p>
<p t="1061066" d="3991">of real variables,
those are the kind calculus is</p>
<p t="1065057" d="3742">concerned with.
But now, it's a complex-valued</p>
<p t="1068799" d="3077">function because the variable is
real.</p>
<p t="1071876" d="3825">But, the output,
the value of the function is a</p>
<p t="1075701" d="2578">complex number.
Now, in general,</p>
<p t="1078279" d="3409">such a function,
well, maybe a better say,</p>
<p t="1081688" d="3243">complex-valued,
how about complex-valued</p>
<p t="1084931" d="4657">function of a real variable,
let's change the name of the</p>
<p t="1089588" d="4912">variable.
t is always a real variable.</p>
<p t="1094500" d="5000">I don't think we have complex
time yet, although I'm sure</p>
<p t="1099500" d="4732">there will be someday.
But, the next Einstein appears.</p>
<p t="1104232" d="3928">A complex-valued function of a
real variable,</p>
<p t="1108160" d="3840">t, in general,
would look like this.</p>
<p t="1112000" d="3683">t goes in, and what comes out?
Well: a complex number,</p>
<p t="1115683" d="2849">which I would then have to
write this way.</p>
<p t="1118532" d="2919">In other words,
the real part depends on t,</p>
<p t="1121451" d="2572">and the imaginary part depends
upon t.</p>
<p t="1124023" d="3336">So, a general function looks
like this, a general</p>
<p t="1127359" d="3752">complex-valued function.
This is just a special case of</p>
<p t="1131111" d="2989">it, where the variable has a
different name.</p>
<p t="1134100" d="3892">But, the first function would
be cosine t, and the second</p>
<p t="1137992" d="3405">function would be sine t.
So, my only question is,</p>
<p t="1141397" d="2572">how do you differentiate such a
thing?</p>
<p t="1143969" d="4031">Well, I'm not going to fuss
over this.</p>
<p t="1148000" d="3384">The general definition is,
with deltas and whatnot,</p>
<p t="1151384" d="3520">but the end result of a
perfectly fine definition is,</p>
<p t="1154904" d="3655">you differentiate it by
differentiating each component.</p>
<p t="1158559" d="3791">The reason you don't have to
work so very hard is because</p>
<p t="1162350" d="3385">this is a real variable,
and I already know what it</p>
<p t="1165735" d="4265">means to differentiate a
function of a real variable.</p>
<p t="1170000" d="4007">So, I could write it this way,
that the derivative of u plus</p>
<p t="1174007" d="3939">iv, I'll abbreviate it that way,
this means the derivative,</p>
<p t="1177946" d="3599">with respect to whatever
variable, since I didn't tell</p>
<p t="1181545" d="3056">you what the variable in these
functions were,</p>
<p t="1184601" d="4007">well, I don't have to tell you
what I'm differentiating with</p>
<p t="1188608" d="2853">respect to.
It's whatever was there because</p>
<p t="1191461" d="2173">you can't see.
And the answer is,</p>
<p t="1193634" d="4143">it would be the derivative of u
plus i times the derivative of</p>
<p t="1197777" d="3327">v.
You differentiate it just the</p>
<p t="1201104" d="4426">way you would if these were the
components of a motion vector.</p>
<p t="1205530" d="4281">You would get the velocity by
differentiating each component</p>
<p t="1209811" d="2903">separately.
And, that's what you're doing</p>
<p t="1212714" d="2394">here.
Okay, now, the importance of</p>
<p t="1215108" d="4282">that is that it at least tells
me what it is I have to check</p>
<p t="1219390" d="3845">when I check this formula.
So, let's do it now that we</p>
<p t="1223235" d="3338">know what this is.
We know how to differentiate</p>
<p t="1226573" d="2975">the function.
Let's actually differentiate</p>
<p t="1229548" d="3321">it.
That's fortunately,</p>
<p t="1232869" d="4429">by far, the easiest part of the
whole process.</p>
<p t="1237298" d="4133">So, let's do it.
So, what's the derivative?</p>
<p t="1241431" d="3937">Let's go back to t,
our generic variable.</p>
<p t="1245368" d="6101">I want to emphasize that these
functions, when we write them as</p>
<p t="1251469" d="5315">functions, that theta will
almost never be the variable</p>
<p t="1256784" d="5216">outside of these notes on
complex numbers.</p>
<p t="1262000" d="3405">It will normally be time or
something like that,</p>
<p t="1265405" d="2247">or x, a neutral variable like
x.</p>
<p t="1267652" d="4420">So, what's the derivative of e
to the i theta?</p>
<p t="1272072" d="4348">I'm hoping that it will turn
out to be i e to the i theta,</p>
<p t="1276420" d="3188">and that the yellow law may be</p>
<p t="1279608" d="4058">true just as the green one was.
Okay, let's calculate it.</p>
<p t="1283666" d="2609">It's the derivative,
with respect to,</p>
<p t="1286275" d="4275">unfortunately I can convert t's
to thetas, but not thetas to</p>
<p t="1290550" d="2775">t's.
C'est la vie,</p>
<p t="1293325" d="3366">okay.
Times cosine t plus i sine t,</p>
<p t="1296691" d="3875">and what's that?</p>
<p t="1300566" d="6221">Well, the derivative of cosine
t, differentiating the real and</p>
<p t="1306787" d="4691">imaginary parts separately,
and adding them up.</p>
<p t="1311478" d="5303">It's negative sine t,
plus i times cosine t.</p>
<p t="1316781" d="4488">Now, let's factor out at the i,</p>
<p t="1321269" d="6731">because it says if I factor out
the i, what do I get?</p>
<p t="1328000" d="4965">Well, now, the real part of
what's left would be cosine t.</p>
<p t="1332965" d="2874">And, how about the imaginary
part?</p>
<p t="1335839" d="5314">Do you see, it will be i sine t
because i times i</p>
<p t="1341153" d="3484">gives me that negative one.</p>
<p t="1344637" d="2526">And, what's that?
e to the it.</p>
<p t="1347163" d="3136">i times e to the i t.</p>
<p t="1350299" d="5331">So, that works too.
What about the initial</p>
<p t="1355630" d="2511">condition?
No problem.</p>
<p t="1358141" d="5500">What is y of zero?
What's the function at zero?</p>
<p t="1363641" d="5739">Well, don't say right away,
i times zero is zero,</p>
<p t="1369380" d="4902">so it must be one.
That's illegal because,</p>
<p t="1374282" d="5859">why is that illegal?
It's because in that formula,</p>
<p t="1380141" d="5859">you are not multiplying i times
theta.</p>
<p t="1386000" d="3343">I mean, sort of,
you are, but that formula is</p>
<p t="1389343" d="3571">the meaning of e to 
the i theta.</p>
<p t="1392914" d="3192">Now, it would be very nice if
this is like,</p>
<p t="1396106" d="2356">well, anyway,
you can't do that.</p>
<p t="1398462" d="4635">So, you have to do it by saying
it's the cosine of zero plus i</p>
<p t="1403097" d="3343">times the sine of zero.</p>
<p t="1406440" d="4560">And, how much is that?
The sine of zero is zero.</p>
<p t="1411000" d="4910">Now, it's okay to say i times
zero is zero because that's the</p>
<p t="1415910" d="4583">way complex numbers multiply.
What is the cosine of zero?</p>
<p t="1420493" d="2128">That's one.
So, the answer,</p>
<p t="1422621" d="3601">indeed, turns out to be one.
So, this checks,</p>
<p t="1426222" d="4992">really, from every conceivable
standpoint down as I indicated,</p>
<p t="1431214" d="3520">also from the standpoint of
infinite series.</p>
<p t="1434734" d="3355">So, we are definitely allowed
to use this.</p>
<p t="1438089" d="4911">Now, the more general
exponential law is true.</p>
<p t="1443000" d="2891">I'm not going to say much about
it.</p>
<p t="1445891" d="3997">So, in other words,
e to the a, this is really a</p>
<p t="1449888" d="3402">definition.
e to the (a plus ib)</p>
<p t="1453290" d="3827">is going to be,
in order for the general</p>
<p t="1457117" d="4677">exponential law to be true,
this is really a definition.</p>
<p t="1461794" d="4252">It's e to the a times e to the
ib.</p>
<p t="1466046" d="4593">Now, notice when I look at
the-- at any complex number,</p>
<p t="1470639" d="3501">--
-- so, in terms of this,</p>
<p t="1474140" d="4726">the polar form of a complex
number, to draw the little</p>
<p t="1478866" d="3923">picture again,
if here is our complex number,</p>
<p t="1482789" d="3746">and here is r,
and here is the angle theta,</p>
<p t="1486535" d="5261">so the nice way to write this
complex number is r e to the i</p>
<p t="1491796" d="4547">theta.
The e to the i theta</p>
<p t="1496343" d="3657">is, now, why is that?</p>
<p t="1500000" d="4382">What is the magnitude of this?
This is r.</p>
<p t="1504382" d="5696">The length of the absolute
value, I didn't talk about</p>
<p t="1510078" d="4820">magnitude in argument.
I guess I should have.</p>
<p t="1514898" d="5587">But, it's in the notes.
So, r is called the modulus.</p>
<p t="1520485" d="3835">Well, the fancy word is the
modulus.</p>
<p t="1524320" d="5149">And, we haven't given the
complex number a name.</p>
<p t="1529469" d="4053">Let's call it alpha,
modulus of alpha,</p>
<p t="1533522" d="5478">and theta is called,
it's the angle.</p>
<p t="1539000" d="5400">It's called the argument.
I didn't make up these words.</p>
<p t="1544400" d="5300">There, from a tradition of
English that has long since</p>
<p t="1549700" d="5599">vanished, when I was a kid,
and you wanted to know what a</p>
<p t="1555299" d="4201">play was about,
you looked in the playbill,</p>
<p t="1559500" d="6000">and it said the argument of the
play, it's that old-fashioned</p>
<p t="1565500" d="6312">use of the word argument.
Argument means the angle,</p>
<p t="1571812" d="4950">and sometimes that's
abbreviated by arg alpha.</p>
<p t="1576762" d="4500">And, this is abbreviated,</p>
<p t="1581262" d="5513">of course, as absolute value of
alpha, its length.</p>
<p t="1586775" d="6412">Okay, the notes give you a
little practice changing things</p>
<p t="1593187" d="6102">to a polar form.
I think we will skip that in</p>
<p t="1599289" d="7048">favor of doing a couple of other
things because that's pretty</p>
<p t="1606337" d="4229">easy.
But let me, you should at least</p>
<p t="1610566" d="4934">realize when you should look at
polar form.</p>
<p t="1615500" d="6343">The great advantage of polar
form is, particularly once</p>
<p t="1621843" d="6813">you've mastered the exponential
law, the great advantage of</p>
<p t="1628656" d="6344">polar form is it's good for
multiplication.</p>
<p t="1635000" d="2838">Now, of course,
you know how to multiply</p>
<p t="1637838" d="2984">complex numbers,
even when they are in the</p>
<p t="1640822" d="2983">Cartesian form.
That's the first thing you</p>
<p t="1643805" d="3785">learn in high school,
how to multiply a plus bi times</p>
<p t="1647590" d="3784">c plus di.
But, as you will see,</p>
<p t="1651374" d="4003">when push comes to shove,
you will see this very clearly</p>
<p t="1655377" d="3711">on Friday when we talk about
trigonometric inputs to</p>
<p t="1659088" d="2912">differential equations,
--</p>
<p t="1662000" d="4028">-- that the changing to complex
numbers makes all sorts of</p>
<p t="1666028" d="3463">things easy to calculate,
and the answers come out</p>
<p t="1669491" d="3251">extremely clear,
whereas if we had to do it any</p>
<p t="1672742" d="3462">other way, it's a lot more work.
And worst of all,</p>
<p t="1676204" d="4029">when you finally slog through
to the end, you fear you are</p>
<p t="1680233" d="3725">none the wiser.
It's good for multiplication</p>
<p t="1683958" d="3288">because the product,
so here's any number in its</p>
<p t="1687246" d="2449">polar form.
That's a general complex</p>
<p t="1689695" d="2518">number.
It's modulus times e to the i</p>
<p t="1692213" d="4058">theta times r two e to the i
theta two-- </p>
<p t="1696271" d="3358">Well,
you just multiply them as</p>
<p t="1699629" d="3288">ordinary numbers.
So, the part out front will be</p>
<p t="1702917" d="3988">r1 r2, and the e to the i theta
parts gets</p>
<p t="1706905" d="3848">multiplied by the exponential
law and becomes e to the i</p>
<p t="1710753" d="5247">(theta one plus theta two) --</p>
<p t="1716000" d="6206">-- which makes very clear that
the multiply geometrically two</p>
<p t="1722206" d="4138">complex numbers,
you multiply the moduli,</p>
<p t="1726344" d="6207">the r's, the absolute values,
how long the arrow is from zero</p>
<p t="1732551" d="4345">to the complex number,
multiply the moduli,</p>
<p t="1736896" d="5155">and add the arguments.
So the new number,</p>
<p t="1742051" d="5585">its modulus is the product of
r1 and r2.</p>
<p t="1747636" d="4672">And, its argument,
its angle, polar angle,</p>
<p t="1752308" d="3647">is the sum of the old two
angles.</p>
<p t="1755955" d="6269">And, you add the angles.
And, you put down in your books</p>
<p t="1762224" d="3875">angles, but I'm being
photographed,</p>
<p t="1766099" d="4901">so I'm going to write
arguments.</p>
<p t="1771000" d="3389">In other words,
it makes the geometric content</p>
<p t="1774389" d="3842">of multiplication clear,
in a sense in which this is</p>
<p t="1778231" d="2410">extremely unclear.
From this law,</p>
<p t="1780641" d="3465">blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, whatever it turns</p>
<p t="1784106" d="4444">out to be, you have not the
slightest intuition that this is</p>
<p t="1788550" d="4294">true about the complex numbers.
That first thing is just a</p>
<p t="1792844" d="4368">formula, whereas this thing is
insightful representation of</p>
<p t="1797212" d="5568">complex multiplication.
Now, I'd like to use it for</p>
<p t="1802780" d="5870">something, but before we do
that, let me just indicate how</p>
<p t="1808650" d="5767">just the exponential notation
enables you to do things in</p>
<p t="1814417" d="5561">calculus, formulas that are
impossible to remember from</p>
<p t="1819978" d="3604">calculus.
It makes them very easy to</p>
<p t="1823582" d="3707">derive.
A typical example of that is,</p>
<p t="1827289" d="3296">suppose you want to,
for example,</p>
<p t="1830585" d="7415">integrate (e to the negative x)
cosine x.</p>
<p t="1838000" d="3450">Well, number one,
you spend a few minutes running</p>
<p t="1841450" d="4096">through a calculus textbook and
try to find out the answer</p>
<p t="1845546" d="4241">because you know you are not
going to remember how to do it.</p>
<p t="1849787" d="3450">Or, you run to a computer,
and type in Matlab and</p>
<p t="1853237" d="2731">something.
Or, you fish out your little</p>
<p t="1855968" d="3450">pocket calculator,
which will give you a formula,</p>
<p t="1859418" d="3928">and so on.
So, you have aides for doing</p>
<p t="1863346" d="3017">that.
But, the way to do it if you're</p>
<p t="1866363" d="3771">on a desert island,
and the way I always do it</p>
<p t="1870134" d="4441">because I never have any of
these little aides around,</p>
<p t="1874575" d="4776">and I cannot trust my memory,
probably a certain number of</p>
<p t="1879351" d="5028">you remember how you did it at
high school, or how you did it</p>
<p t="1884379" d="5028">in 18.01, if you took it here.
You have to use integration by</p>
<p t="1889407" d="3604">parts.
But, it's one of the tricky</p>
<p t="1893011" d="4395">things that's not required on an
exam because you had to use</p>
<p t="1897406" d="3575">integration by parts twice in
the same direction,</p>
<p t="1900981" d="4619">and then suddenly by comparing
the end product with the initial</p>
<p t="1905600" d="4544">product and writing an equation.
Somehow, the value falls out.</p>
<p t="1910144" d="3725">Well, that's tricky.
And it's not the sort of thing</p>
<p t="1913869" d="4693">you can waste time stuffing into
your head, unless you are going</p>
<p t="1918562" d="5438">to be the integration bee during
IAP or something like that.</p>
<p t="1924000" d="5281">Instead, using complex numbers
is the way to do this.</p>
<p t="1929281" d="3250">How do I think of this,
cosine x?</p>
<p t="1932531" d="5789">What I do, is I think of that e
to the negative x cosine x</p>
<p t="1938320" d="5789">is the real
part, the real part of what?</p>
<p t="1944109" d="5789">Well, cosine x is the real part
of e to the ix.</p>
<p t="1949898" d="2844">So, this thing,
this is real.</p>
<p t="1952742" d="1726">This is real,
too.</p>
<p t="1954468" d="5383">But I'm thinking of it as the
real part of e to the ix.</p>
<p t="1959851" d="5513">Now, if I multiply these two</p>
<p t="1965364" d="4391">together, this is going to turn
out to be, therefore,</p>
<p t="1969755" d="3716">the real part of e to the minus
x.</p>
<p t="1973471" d="4391">I'll write it out very
pompously, and then I will fix</p>
<p t="1977862" d="2364">it.
I would never write this,</p>
<p t="1980226" d="4752">you are you.
Okay, it's e to the minus x</p>
<p t="1984978" d="4634">times, when I write cosine x
plus i sine x,</p>
<p t="1989612" d="4633">so it is the real part of that
is cosine x.</p>
<p t="1994245" d="6288">So, it's the real part of,
write it this way for real part</p>
<p t="2000533" d="5737">of e to the, factor out the x,
and what's up there is</p>
<p t="2006270" d="6730">(negative one plus i) times x.</p>
<p t="2013000" d="3777">Okay, and now,
so, the idea is the same thing</p>
<p t="2016777" d="3090">is going to be true for the
integral.</p>
<p t="2019867" d="3520">This is going to be the real
part of that,</p>
<p t="2023387" d="5322">the integral of e to the (minus
one plus i) times x dx.</p>
<p t="2028709" d="2318">In other words,</p>
<p t="2031027" d="3348">what you do is,
this procedure is called</p>
<p t="2034375" d="4464">complexifying the integral.
Instead of looking at the</p>
<p t="2038839" d="4207">original real problem,
I'm going to turn it into a</p>
<p t="2043046" d="4378">complex problem by turning this
thing into a complex</p>
<p t="2047424" d="4635">exponential.
This is the real part of that</p>
<p t="2052059" d="3408">complex exponential.
Now, what's the advantage of</p>
<p t="2055467" d="1278">doing that?
Simple.</p>
<p t="2056745" d="3550">It's because nothing is easier
to integrate than an</p>
<p t="2060295" d="2912">exponential.
And, though you may have some</p>
<p t="2063207" d="3692">doubts as to whether the
familiar laws work also with</p>
<p t="2066899" d="3266">complex exponentials,
I assure you they all do.</p>
<p t="2070165" d="3835">It would be lovely to sit and
prove them.</p>
<p t="2074000" d="3419">On the other hand,
I think after a while,</p>
<p t="2077419" d="4360">you find it rather dull.
So, I'm going to do the fun</p>
<p t="2081779" d="4617">things, and assume that they are
true because they are.</p>
<p t="2086396" d="4958">So, what's the integral of e to
the (minus one plus i) x dx?</p>
<p t="2094090" d="4702">Well, if there is justice in
heaven, it must be e to the</p>
<p t="2098792" d="4531">(minus one plus i) times x
divided by minus one plus i.</p>
<p t="2103323" d="5312">In some sense,</p>
<p t="2108635" d="4322">that's the answer.
This does, in fact,</p>
<p t="2112957" d="2921">give that.
That's correct.</p>
<p t="2115878" d="6659">I want the real part of this.
I want the real part because</p>
<p t="2122537" d="5374">that's the way the original
problem was stated.</p>
<p t="2127911" d="7049">I want the real part only.
So, I want the real part of</p>
<p t="2134960" d="3946">this.
Now, this is what separates the</p>
<p t="2138906" d="5701">girls from the women.
[LAUGHTER] This is why you have</p>
<p t="2144607" d="4057">to know how to divide complex
numbers.</p>
<p t="2148664" d="3728">So, watch how I find the real
part.</p>
<p t="2152392" d="4604">I write it this way.
Normally when I do the</p>
<p t="2156996" d="5920">calculations for myself,
I would skip a couple of these</p>
<p t="2162916" d="2973">steps.
But this time,</p>
<p t="2165889" d="3748">I will write everything out.
You're going to have to do this</p>
<p t="2169637" d="2922">a lot in this course,
by the way, both over the</p>
<p t="2172559" d="3748">course of the next few weeks,
and especially towards the end</p>
<p t="2176307" d="2986">of the term where we get into a
complex systems,</p>
<p t="2179293" d="3303">which involve complex numbers.
There's a lot of this.</p>
<p t="2182596" d="3875">So, now is the time to learn to
do it, and to feel skillful at</p>
<p t="2186471" d="1969">it.
So, it's this times e to the</p>
<p t="2188440" d="3049">negative x times e to the ix,</p>
<p t="2191489" d="4511">which is cosine x plus 
i sine x.</p>
<p t="2196000" d="3233">Now, I'm not ready,
yet, to do the calculation to</p>
<p t="2199233" d="3906">find the real part because I
don't like the way this looks.</p>
<p t="2203139" d="3570">I want to go back to the thing
I did right at the very</p>
<p t="2206709" d="3436">beginning of the hour,
and turn it into an a plus bi</p>
<p t="2210145" d="2222">type of complex
number.</p>
<p t="2212367" d="2695">In other words,
what we have to do is the</p>
<p t="2215062" d="2492">division.
So, the division is going to</p>
<p t="2217554" d="4446">be, now, I'm going to ask you to
do it in your head.</p>
<p t="2222000" d="4416">I multiply the top and bottom
by negative one minus I.</p>
<p t="2226416" d="3084">What does that put in the
denominator?</p>
<p t="2229500" d="4250">One squared plus one squared:
Two.</p>
<p t="2233750" d="4000">And in the numerator,
negative one minus i.</p>
<p t="2237750" d="2416">This is the same as that.</p>
<p t="2240166" d="3917">But now, it looks at the form a
+ bi.</p>
<p t="2244083" d="4750">It's negative one over two
minus i times one half.</p>
<p t="2248833" d="4434">So, this is multiplied by e to</p>
<p t="2253267" d="3173">the minus x and cosine x.</p>
<p t="2256440" d="3779">So, if you are doing it,
and practice a little bit,</p>
<p t="2260219" d="2644">please don't put in all these
steps.</p>
<p t="2262863" d="3174">Go from here;
well, I would go from here to</p>
<p t="2266037" d="2645">here by myself.
Maybe you shouldn't.</p>
<p t="2268682" d="2721">Practice a little before you do
that.</p>
<p t="2271403" d="2418">And now, what do we do with
this?</p>
<p t="2273821" d="3627">Now, this is in a form to pick
out the real part.</p>
<p t="2277448" d="5604">We want the real part of this.
So, you don't have to write the</p>
<p t="2283052" d="2317">whole thing out as a complex
number.</p>
<p t="2285369" d="2847">In other words,
you don't have to do all the</p>
<p t="2288216" d="3046">multiplications.
You only have to find the real</p>
<p t="2291262" d="3377">part of it, which is what?
Well, e to the negative x</p>
<p t="2294639" d="2251">will be simply a factor.</p>
<p t="2296890" d="3178">That's a real factor,
which I don't have to worry</p>
<p t="2300068" d="1854">about.
And, in that category,</p>
<p t="2301922" d="3840">I can include the two also.
So, I only have to pick out the</p>
<p t="2305762" d="4238">real part of this times that.
And, what's that?</p>
<p t="2310000" d="2609">It's negative cosine x.</p>
<p t="2312609" d="4528">And, the other real part comes
from the product of these two</p>
<p t="2317137" d="2917">things.
I times negative i is one.</p>
<p t="2320054" d="2686">And, what's left is sine x.</p>
<p t="2322740" d="2993">So, that's the answer to the</p>
<p t="2325733" d="3070">question.
That's the integral of e to the</p>
<p t="2328803" d="3838">negative x * cosine x.</p>
<p t="2332641" d="3760">Notice, it's a completely
straightforward process.</p>
<p t="2336401" d="4452">It doesn't involve any tricks,
unless you call going to the</p>
<p t="2340853" d="4002">complex domain a trick.
But, I don't.</p>
<p t="2344855" d="3686">As soon as you see in this
course the combination of e to</p>
<p t="2348541" d="3094">ax times cosine bx or sine bx,</p>
<p t="2351635" d="2699">you should immediately think,</p>
<p t="2354334" d="3817">and you're going to get plenty
of it in the couple of weeks</p>
<p t="2358151" d="2962">after the exam,
you are going to get plenty of</p>
<p t="2361113" d="4016">it, and you should immediately
think of passing to the complex</p>
<p t="2365129" d="2369">domain.
That will be the standard way</p>
<p t="2367498" d="5246">we solve such problems.
So, you're going to get lots of</p>
<p t="2372744" d="4339">practice doing this.
But, this was the first time.</p>
<p t="2377083" d="4958">Now, I guess in the time
remaining, I'm not going to talk</p>
<p t="2382041" d="2834">about in the notes,
i, R, at all,</p>
<p t="2384875" d="5046">but I would like to talk a
little bit about the extraction</p>
<p t="2389921" d="4516">of the complex roots,
since you have a problem about</p>
<p t="2394437" d="5135">that and because it's another
beautiful application of this</p>
<p t="2399572" d="4428">polar way of writing complex
numbers.</p>
<p t="2404000" d="5978">Suppose I want to calculate.
So, the basic problem is to</p>
<p t="2409978" d="5978">calculate the nth roots of one.
Now, in the real domain,</p>
<p t="2415956" d="5870">of course, the answer is,
sometimes there's only one of</p>
<p t="2421826" d="5000">these, one itself,
and sometimes there are two,</p>
<p t="2426826" d="7174">depending on whether n is an
even number or an odd number.</p>
<p t="2434000" d="6719">But, in the complex domain,
there are always n answers as</p>
<p t="2440719" d="5161">complex numbers.
One always has n nth roots.</p>
<p t="2445880" d="4799">Now, where are they?
Well, geometrically,</p>
<p t="2450679" d="3721">it's easy to see where they
are.</p>
<p t="2454400" d="6600">Here's the unit circle.
Here's the unit circle.</p>
<p t="2461000" d="3428">One of the roots is right here
at one.</p>
<p t="2464428" d="4818">Now, where are the others?
Well, do you see that if I</p>
<p t="2469246" d="5744">place, let's take n equal five
because that's a nice,</p>
<p t="2474990" d="3799">dramatic number.
If I place these peptides</p>
<p t="2478789" d="4447">equally spaced points around the
unit circle, so,</p>
<p t="2483236" d="3243">in other words,
this angle is alpha.</p>
<p t="2486479" d="6472">Alpha should be the angle.
What would be the expression</p>
<p t="2492951" d="4217">for that?
If there were five such equally</p>
<p t="2497168" d="6536">spaced, it would be one fifth of
all the way around the circle.</p>
<p t="2503704" d="4112">All the way around the circle
is two pi.</p>
<p t="2507816" d="4744">So, it will be one fifth of two
pi in radians.</p>
<p t="2512560" d="6114">Now, it's geometrically clear
that those are the five fifth</p>
<p t="2518674" d="4112">roots because,
how do I multiply complex</p>
<p t="2522786" d="4180">numbers?
I multiply the moduli.</p>
<p t="2526966" d="4828">Well, they all have moduli one.
So, if I take this guy,</p>
<p t="2531794" d="4828">let's call that complex number,
oh, I hate to give you,</p>
<p t="2536622" d="3666">they are always giving you
Greek notation.</p>
<p t="2540288" d="3218">All right, why not torture you?
Zeta.</p>
<p t="2543506" d="5096">At least you will learn how to
make a zeta in this period,</p>
<p t="2548602" d="5408">small zeta, so that's zeta.
There's our fifth root of</p>
<p t="2554010" d="2896">unity.
It's the first one that occurs</p>
<p t="2556906" d="3619">on the circle that isn't the
trivial one, one.</p>
<p t="2560525" d="4021">Now, do you see that,
how would I calculate zeta to</p>
<p t="2564546" d="3218">the fifth?
Well, if I write zeta in polar</p>
<p t="2567764" d="4182">notation, what would it be?
The modulus would be one,</p>
<p t="2571946" d="4423">and therefore it will be
simply, the r will be one</p>
<p t="2576369" d="2896">for it because its length is
one.</p>
<p t="2579265" d="3874">Its modulus is one.
What's up here?</p>
<p t="2583139" d="3645">I times that angle,
and that angle is two pi over</p>
<p t="2586784" d="2507">five. So, there's just,</p>
<p t="2589291" d="2506">geometrically I see where zeta
is.</p>
<p t="2591797" d="3949">And, if I translate that
geometry into the e to the i</p>
<p t="2595746" d="4633">theta form for
the formula, I see that it must</p>
<p t="2600379" d="3342">be that number.
Now, let's say somebody gives</p>
<p t="2603721" d="4177">you that number and says,
hey, is this the fifth root of</p>
<p t="2607898" d="2127">one?
I forbid you to draw any</p>
<p t="2610025" d="3393">pictures.
What would you do?</p>
<p t="2613418" d="3153">You say, well,
I'll raise it to the fifth</p>
<p t="2616571" d="2916">power.
What's zeta to the fifth power?</p>
<p t="2619487" d="4256">Well, it's e to the i two pi /
five,</p>
<p t="2623743" d="4257">and now, if I think of raising
that to the fifth power,</p>
<p t="2628000" d="3704">by the exponential law,
that's the same thing as</p>
<p t="2631704" d="3074">putting a five in front of the
exponent.</p>
<p t="2634778" d="2837">So, this times five,
and what's that?</p>
<p t="2637615" d="3626">That's e to the i times two pi.</p>
<p t="2641241" d="5434">And, what is that?
Well, it's the angle.</p>
<p t="2646675" d="6498">If the angle is two pi,
I've gone all the way around</p>
<p t="2653173" d="4460">the circle and come back here
again.</p>
<p t="2657633" d="5096">I've got the number one.
So, this is one.</p>
<p t="2662729" d="5606">Since the argument,
two pi, is the same as an</p>
<p t="2668335" d="6753">angle, it's the same as,
well, let's not write it that</p>
<p t="2675088" d="4475">way. It's wrong.</p>
<p t="2679563" d="13048">It's just wrong since two pi
and zero are the same angle.</p>
<p t="2692611" d="8389">So, I could replace this by
zero.</p>
<p t="2701000" d="8267">Oh dear.
Well, I guess I have to stop</p>
<p t="2709267" d="13090">right in the middle of things.
So, you're going to have to</p>
<p t="2722357" d="13779">read a little bit about how to
find roots in order to do that</p>
<p t="2736136" d="8267">problem.
And, we will go on from that</p>
<p t="2744403" d="1000">point Friday.</p>
