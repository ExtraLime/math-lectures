<p t="1000" d="3581">I usually like to start a
lecture with something new,</p>
<p t="4581" d="3031">but this time I'm going to make
an exception,</p>
<p t="7612" d="4271">and start with the finishing up
on Friday because it involves a</p>
<p t="11883" d="2824">little more practice with
complex numbers.</p>
<p t="14707" d="3927">I think that's what a large
number of you are still fairly</p>
<p t="18634" d="2342">weak in.
So, to briefly remind you,</p>
<p t="20976" d="2273">it will be sort of
self-contained,</p>
<p t="23249" d="2617">but still, it will use complex
numbers.</p>
<p t="25866" d="4134">And, I think it's a good way to
start today.</p>
<p t="30000" d="3929">So, remember,
the basic problem was to solve</p>
<p t="33929" d="4112">something with,
where the input was sinusoidal</p>
<p t="38041" d="3473">in particular.
The k was on both sides,</p>
<p t="41514" d="5209">and the input looked like
cosine omega t.</p>
<p t="46723" d="5300">And, the plan of the solution
consisted of transporting the</p>
<p t="52023" d="5117">problem to the complex domain.
So, you look for a complex</p>
<p t="57140" d="5849">solution, and you complexify the
right hand side of the equation,</p>
<p t="62989" d="4408">as well.
So, cosine omega t</p>
<p t="67397" d="4076">becomes the real part of
this complex function.</p>
<p t="71473" d="4157">The reason for doing that,
remember, was because it's</p>
<p t="75630" d="3836">easier to handle when you solve
linear equations.</p>
<p t="79466" d="4476">It's much easier to handle
exponentials on the right-hand</p>
<p t="83942" d="5035">side than it is to handle sines
and cosines because exponentials</p>
<p t="88977" d="4396">are so easy to integrate when
you multiply them by other</p>
<p t="93373" d="2558">exponentials.
So, the result was,</p>
<p t="95931" d="3676">after doing that,
y tilda turned out to be one,</p>
<p t="99607" d="4796">after I scale the coefficient,
one over one plus omega over k</p>
<p t="104403" d="6938">And then, the rest was e to the</p>
<p t="111341" d="5605">i times (omega t minus phi),</p>
<p t="116946" d="3341">where phi had a certain
meaning.</p>
<p t="120287" d="5713">It was the arc tangent of a,
it was a phase lag.</p>
<p t="126000" d="3491">And, this was then,
I had to take the real part of</p>
<p t="129491" d="4204">this to get the final answer,
which came out to be something</p>
<p t="133695" d="4560">like one over the square root of
one plus the amplitude one omega</p>
<p t="138255" d="4204">/ k squared, and then the rest
was cosine omega t plus minus</p>
<p t="142459" d="3919">phi.</p>
<p t="146378" d="4133">It's easier to see that that
part is the real part of this;</p>
<p t="150511" d="3135">the problem is,
of course you have to convert</p>
<p t="153646" d="3938">this.
Sorry, this should be i omega</p>
<p t="157584" d="4188">t, in which case you don't need
the parentheses,</p>
<p t="161772" d="3297">either.
So, the problem was to use the</p>
<p t="165069" d="4990">polar representation of this
complex number to convert it</p>
<p t="170059" d="5257">into something whose amplitude
was this, and whose angle was</p>
<p t="175316" d="3386">minus phi.
Now, that's what we call the</p>
<p t="178702" d="3298">polar method,
going polar.</p>
<p t="182000" d="2896">I'd like, now,
for the first few minutes of</p>
<p t="184896" d="2897">the period, to talk about the
other method,</p>
<p t="187793" d="3172">the Cartesian method.
I think for a long while,</p>
<p t="190965" d="3655">many of you will be more
comfortable with that anyway.</p>
<p t="194620" d="4276">Although, one of the objects of
the course should be to get you</p>
<p t="198896" d="4069">equally comfortable with the
polar representation of complex</p>
<p t="202965" d="2483">numbers.
So, if we try to do the same</p>
<p t="205448" d="3103">thing going Cartesian,
what's going to happen?</p>
<p t="208551" d="3449">Well, I guess the same point
here.</p>
<p t="212000" d="5253">So, the starting point is still
y tilde equals one over,</p>
<p t="217253" d="5349">sorry, this should have an i
here, one plus i times omega</p>
<p t="222602" d="5732">over k, e to the i omega t.</p>
<p t="228334" d="3821">But now, what you're going to</p>
<p t="232155" d="5062">do is turn this into its
Cartesian, turn both of these</p>
<p t="237217" d="4968">into their Cartesian
representations as a plus ib.</p>
<p t="242185" d="3889">So, if you do that Cartesianly,</p>
<p t="246074" d="3815">of course, what you have to do
is the standard thing about</p>
<p t="249889" d="3747">dividing complex numbers or
taking the reciprocals that I</p>
<p t="253636" d="3279">told you at the very beginning
of complex numbers.</p>
<p t="256915" d="4216">You multiply the top and bottom
by the complex conjugate of this</p>
<p t="261131" d="2142">in order to make the bottom
real.</p>
<p t="263273" d="3748">So, what does this become?
This becomes one minus i times</p>
<p t="267021" d="3814">omega over k divided by the
product of this in its complex</p>
<p t="270835" d="3815">conjugate, which is the real
number, one plus omega over k</p>
<p t="274650" d="4350">squared</p>
<p t="279000" d="4317">So, I've now converted this to
the a plus bi form.</p>
<p t="283317" d="4174">I have also to convert the
right-hand side to the a plus bi</p>
<p t="287491" d="2375">form.
So, it will look like cosine</p>
<p t="289866" d="3957">omega t plus i sine omega t.</p>
<p t="293823" d="1583">Having done that,</p>
<p t="295406" d="3670">I take the last step,
which is to take the real part</p>
<p t="299076" d="2807">of that.
Remember, the reason I want the</p>
<p t="301883" d="4533">real part is because this input
was the real part of the complex</p>
<p t="306416" d="3827">input.
So, once you've got the complex</p>
<p t="310243" d="4270">solution, you have to take its
real part to go back into the</p>
<p t="314513" d="2894">domain you started with,
of real numbers,</p>
<p t="317407" d="2461">from the domain of complex
numbers.</p>
<p t="319868" d="4053">So, I want the real part is
going to be, the real part of</p>
<p t="323921" d="3763">that is, first of all,
there's a factor out in front.</p>
<p t="327684" d="4496">That's entirely real.
Let's put that out in front,</p>
<p t="332180" d="2569">so doesn't bother us
particularly.</p>
<p t="334749" d="4516">And now, I need the product of
this complex number and that</p>
<p t="339265" d="3503">complex number.
But, I only want the real part</p>
<p t="342768" d="2725">of it.
So, I'm not going to multiply</p>
<p t="345493" d="4283">it out and get four terms.
I'm just going to look at the</p>
<p t="349776" d="3815">two terms that I do want.
I don't want the others.</p>
<p t="353591" d="4593">All right, the real part is
cosine omega t,</p>
<p t="358184" d="3816">from the product of this and
that.</p>
<p t="362000" d="5812">And, the rest of the real part
will be the product of the two i</p>
<p t="367812" d="3281">terms.
But, it's i times negative i,</p>
<p t="371093" d="2813">which makes one.
And therefore,</p>
<p t="373906" d="4781">it's omega over k times sine
omega t.</p>
<p t="378687" d="3563">Now, that's the answer.</p>
<p t="382250" d="4312">And that's the answer,
too; they must be equal,</p>
<p t="386562" d="5438">unless there's a contradiction
in mathematics.</p>
<p t="392000" d="4485">But, it's extremely important.
And that's the other reason why</p>
<p t="396485" d="3603">I'm giving you this,
that you learn in this course</p>
<p t="400088" d="4264">to be able to convert quickly
and automatically things that</p>
<p t="404352" d="3383">look like this into things that
look like that.</p>
<p t="407735" d="3235">And, that's done by means of a
basic formula,</p>
<p t="410970" d="3677">which occurs at the end of the
notes for reference,</p>
<p t="414647" d="3897">as I optimistically say,
although I think for a lot of</p>
<p t="418544" d="3823">you will not be referenced,
stuff in the category of,</p>
<p t="422367" d="4633">yeah, I think I've vaguely seen
that somewhere.</p>
<p t="427000" d="3076">But, well, we never used it for
anything.</p>
<p t="430076" d="2847">Okay, you're going to use it
all term.</p>
<p t="432923" d="3307">So, the formula is,
the famous trigonometric</p>
<p t="436230" d="3693">identity, which is,
so, the problem is to convert</p>
<p t="439923" d="4077">this into the other guy.
And, the thing which is going</p>
<p t="444000" d="4307">to do that, enable one to
combine the sine and the cosine</p>
<p t="448307" d="4000">terms, is the famous formula
that a times the cosine,</p>
<p t="452307" d="4308">I'm going to use theta to make
it as neutral as possible,</p>
<p t="456615" d="3415">--
-- so, theta you can think of</p>
<p t="460030" d="4272">as being replaced by omega t in
this particular application of</p>
<p t="464302" d="2801">the formula.
But, I'll just use a general</p>
<p t="467103" d="3992">angle theta, which doesn't
suggest anything in particular.</p>
<p t="471095" d="3361">So, the problem is,
you have something which is a</p>
<p t="474456" d="3712">combination with real
coefficients of cosine and sine,</p>
<p t="478168" d="4832">and the important thing is that
these numbers be the same.</p>
<p t="483000" d="3025">In practice,
that means that the omega t,</p>
<p t="486025" d="4235">you're not allowed to have
omega one t here,</p>
<p t="490260" d="4160">and some other frequency,
omega two t here.</p>
<p t="494420" d="3403">That would correspond to using
theta one here,</p>
<p t="497823" d="3706">and theta two here.
And, though there is a formula</p>
<p t="501529" d="2949">for combining that,
nobody remembers it,</p>
<p t="504478" d="3706">and it's, in general,
less universally useful than</p>
<p t="508184" d="4765">the first.
If you're going to memorize a</p>
<p t="512949" d="5593">formula, and learn this one,
it's best to start with the</p>
<p t="518542" d="5491">ones where the two are equal.
That's the basic formula.</p>
<p t="524033" d="5492">The others are variations of
it, but there is a sizable</p>
<p t="529525" d="3864">variations.
All right, so the answer is</p>
<p t="533389" d="5695">that this is equal to some other
constant, real constant,</p>
<p t="539084" d="6916">times the cosine of theta minus
phi.</p>
<p t="546000" d="3742">Of course, most people remember
this vaguely.</p>
<p t="549742" d="4593">What they don't remember is
what the c and the phi are,</p>
<p t="554335" d="4252">how to calculate them.
I don't suggest you memorize</p>
<p t="558587" d="3572">the formulas for them.
You can if you wish.</p>
<p t="562159" d="4338">Instead, memorize the picture,
which is much easier.</p>
<p t="566497" d="5018">Memorize that a and b are the
two sides of a right triangle.</p>
<p t="571515" d="5358">Phi is the angle opposite the b
side, and c is the length of the</p>
<p t="576873" d="5249">hypotenuse.
Okay, that's worth putting up.</p>
<p t="582122" d="6140">I think that's a pink formula.
It's even worth two of those,</p>
<p t="588262" d="4683">but I will thrift.
Now, let's apply it to this</p>
<p t="592945" d="4371">case to see that it gives the
right answer.</p>
<p t="597316" d="4684">So, to use this formula,
how I use it?</p>
<p t="602000" d="5698">Well, I should take,
I will reproduce the left-hand</p>
<p t="607698" d="2052">side.
So that part,</p>
<p t="609750" d="4216">I just copy.
And, how about the right?</p>
<p t="613966" d="5357">Well, the amplitude,
it's combined into a single</p>
<p t="619323" d="6496">cosine term whose amplitude is,
well, the two sides of the</p>
<p t="625819" d="7181">right triangle are one,
and omega over k.</p>
<p t="633000" d="3672">The hypotenuse in that case is
going to be, well,</p>
<p t="636672" d="3289">why don't we write it here?
So, we have one,</p>
<p t="639961" d="3443">and omega over k.
And, here's phi.</p>
<p t="643404" d="4590">So, the hypotenuse is going to
be the square root of one plus</p>
<p t="647994" d="3519">omega over k squared.</p>
<p t="651513" d="3825">And, that's going to be
multiplied by the cosine of</p>
<p t="655338" d="4055">omega t minus this phase lag
angle phi.</p>
<p t="659393" d="2919">You can write,</p>
<p t="662312" d="3656">if you wish,
phi equals the arc tangent,</p>
<p t="665968" d="3563">but you are not learning a lot
by that.</p>
<p t="669531" d="5625">Phi is the arc tangent of omega
over k.</p>
<p t="675156" d="1594">That's okay,</p>
<p t="676750" d="3093">but it's true.
But, notice there's</p>
<p t="679843" d="4032">cancellation now.
This over that is equal to</p>
<p t="683875" d="4125">what?
Well, it's equal to this.</p>
<p t="688000" d="3872">And, so when we get in this
way, by combining these two</p>
<p t="691872" d="4374">factors, one gets exactly the
same formula that we got before.</p>
<p t="696246" d="2366">So, as you can see,
in some sense,</p>
<p t="698612" d="2581">there's not,
if you can remember this</p>
<p t="701193" d="3872">trigonometric identity,
there's not a lot of difference</p>
<p t="705065" d="4088">between the two methods except
that this one requires this</p>
<p t="709153" d="2724">extra step.
The answer will come out in</p>
<p t="711877" d="3657">this form, and you then,
to see what it really looks</p>
<p t="715534" d="3155">like, really have to convert it
to this form,</p>
<p t="718689" d="3944">the form in which you can see
what the phase lag and the</p>
<p t="722633" d="4588">amplitude is.
It's amazing how many people</p>
<p t="727221" d="2935">who should know,
this includes working</p>
<p t="730156" d="3331">mathematicians,
theoretical mathematicians,</p>
<p t="733487" d="4125">includes even possibly the
authors of your textbooks.</p>
<p t="737612" d="3332">I'm not sure,
but I've caught them in this,</p>
<p t="740944" d="4046">too, who in this form,
everybody remembers that it's</p>
<p t="744990" d="2697">something like that.
Unfortunately,</p>
<p t="747687" d="3649">when it occurs as the answer in
an answer book,</p>
<p t="751336" d="4522">the numbers are some colossal
mess here plus some colossal</p>
<p t="755858" d="3591">mess here.
And theta is,</p>
<p t="759449" d="5350">again, a real mess,
involving roots and some cube</p>
<p t="764799" d="4125">roots, and whatnot.
The only thing is,</p>
<p t="768924" d="3567">these two are the same real
mess.</p>
<p t="772491" d="6466">That amounts to just another
pure oscillation with the same</p>
<p t="778957" d="6243">frequency as the old guy,
and with the amplitude changed,</p>
<p t="785200" d="6800">and with a phase shift,
move to the right or left.</p>
<p t="792000" d="2989">So, this is no more general
than that.</p>
<p t="794989" d="3556">Notice they both have two
parameters in them,</p>
<p t="798545" d="4364">these two coefficients.
This one has the two parameters</p>
<p t="802909" d="3232">in an altered form.
Okay, well, I wanted,</p>
<p t="806141" d="3313">because of the importance of
this formula,</p>
<p t="809454" d="4687">I wanted to take a couple of
minutes out for a proof of the</p>
<p t="814141" d="1859">formula, --</p>
<p t="822000" d="4449">-- just to give you chance to
stare at it a little more now.</p>
<p t="826449" d="3922">There are three proofs I know.
I'm sure there are 27.</p>
<p t="830371" d="3545">The Pythagorean theorem now has
several hundred.</p>
<p t="833916" d="2489">But, there are three basic
proofs.</p>
<p t="836405" d="4148">There is the one I will not
give you, I'll call the high</p>
<p t="840553" d="2865">school proof,
which is the only one one</p>
<p t="843418" d="3771">normally finds in books,
physics textbooks or other</p>
<p t="847189" d="4125">textbooks.
The high school proof takes the</p>
<p t="851314" d="3211">right-hand side,
applies the formula for the</p>
<p t="854525" d="4704">cosine of the difference of two
angles, which it assumes you had</p>
<p t="859229" d="3509">in trigonometry,
and then converts it into this.</p>
<p t="862738" d="4406">It shows you that once you've
done that, that a turns out to</p>
<p t="867144" d="4405">be c cosine phi
and b, the number b is c sine</p>
<p t="871549" d="3733">phi,
and therefore it identifies the</p>
<p t="875282" d="4034">two sides.
Now, the thing that's of course</p>
<p t="879316" d="3511">correct and it's the simplest
possible argument,</p>
<p t="882827" d="4259">the thing that's no good about
it is that the direction at</p>
<p t="887086" d="2540">which it goes is from here to
here.</p>
<p t="889626" d="3960">Well, everybody knew that.
If I gave you this and told</p>
<p t="893586" d="3362">you, write it out in terms of
cosine and sine,</p>
<p t="896948" d="4483">I would assume it dearly hope
that practically all of you can</p>
<p t="901431" d="2436">do that.
Unfortunately,</p>
<p t="903867" d="3408">when you want to use the
formula, it's this way you want</p>
<p t="907275" d="2169">to use it in the opposite
direction.</p>
<p t="909444" d="3594">You are starting with this,
and want to convert it to that.</p>
<p t="913038" d="2788">Now, the proof,
therefore, will not be of much</p>
<p t="915826" d="2045">help.
It requires you to go in the</p>
<p t="917871" d="2851">backwards direction,
and match up coefficients.</p>
<p t="920722" d="1921">It's much better to go
forwards.</p>
<p t="922643" d="2602">Now, there are two proofs that
go forwards.</p>
<p t="925245" d="3222">There's the 18.02 proof.
Since I didn't teach most of</p>
<p t="928467" d="3533">you 18.02, I can't be sure you
had it.</p>
<p t="932000" d="4578">So, I'll spend one minute
giving it to you.</p>
<p t="936578" d="5670">What is the 18.02 proof?
It is the following picture.</p>
<p t="942248" d="4361">I think this requires deep
colored chalk.</p>
<p t="946609" d="3488">This is going to be pretty
heavy.</p>
<p t="950097" d="5887">All right, first of all,
the a and the b are the given.</p>
<p t="955984" d="5016">So, I'm going to put in that
vector.</p>
<p t="961000" d="4732">So, there is the vector whose
sides are, whose components are</p>
<p t="965732" d="3077">a and b.
I'll write it without the i and</p>
<p t="968809" d="2287">j.
I hope you had from Jerison</p>
<p t="971096" d="3786">that form for the vector,
if you don't like that,</p>
<p t="974882" d="2682">write ai plus bj,
okay?</p>
<p t="977564" d="3313">Now, there's another vector
lurking around.</p>
<p t="980877" d="3944">It's the unit vector whose,
I'll write it this way,</p>
<p t="984821" d="4733">u because it's a unit vector,
and theta to indicate that it's</p>
<p t="989554" d="4715">angle is theta.
Now, the reason for doing that</p>
<p t="994269" d="4388">is because you see that the
left-hand side is a dot product</p>
<p t="998657" d="3026">of two vectors.
The left-hand side of the</p>
<p t="1001683" d="3328">identity is the dot product of
the vector &lt;a,</p>
<p t="1005011" d="4161">b&gt; with the vector whose
components are cosine theta and</p>
<p t="1009172" d="2950">sine theta.</p>
<p t="1012122" d="3026">That's what I'm calling this
unit vector.</p>
<p t="1015148" d="4388">It's a unit vector because
cosine squared plus sine squared</p>
<p t="1019536" d="4464">is one.</p>
<p t="1024000" d="4764">Now, all this formula is,
is saying that scalar product,</p>
<p t="1028764" d="5198">the dot product of those two
vectors, can be evaluated if you</p>
<p t="1033962" d="5025">know their components by the
left-hand side of the formula.</p>
<p t="1038987" d="5112">And, if you don't know their
components, it can be evaluated</p>
<p t="1044099" d="3465">in another way,
the geometric evaluation,</p>
<p t="1047564" d="4072">which goes, what is it?
It's a magnitude of one,</p>
<p t="1051636" d="4851">times the magnitude of the
other, times the cosine of the</p>
<p t="1056487" d="6372">included angle.
Now, what's the included angle?</p>
<p t="1062859" d="7098">Well, theta is this angle from
the horizontal to that unit</p>
<p t="1069957" d="4358">vector.
The angle phi is this angle,</p>
<p t="1074315" d="4607">from this picture here.
And therefore,</p>
<p t="1078922" d="6972">the included angle between
(u)theta and my pink vector is</p>
<p t="1085894" d="6561">theta minus phi.
That's the formula.</p>
<p t="1092455" d="4215">It comes from two ways of
calculating the scalar product</p>
<p t="1096670" d="4828">of the vector whose coefficients
are, and the unit vector</p>
<p t="1101498" d="3601">whose components are cosine
theta and sine theta.</p>
<p t="1105099" d="3142">All right, well,</p>
<p t="1108241" d="6815">you should, that was 18.02.</p>
<p t="1115056" d="1303">There must be an 18.03 proof
also. Yes.</p>
<p t="1116359" d="7388">What's the 18.03 proof?
The 18.03 proof uses complex</p>
<p t="1123747" d="3187">numbers.
It says, look,</p>
<p t="1126934" d="6808">take the left side.
Instead of viewing it as the</p>
<p t="1133742" d="8258">dot product of two vectors,
there's another way.</p>
<p t="1142000" d="4765">You can think of it as the part
of the products of two complex</p>
<p t="1146765" d="2422">numbers.
So, the 18.03 argument,</p>
<p t="1149187" d="3125">really, the complex number
argument says,</p>
<p t="1152312" d="4688">look, multiply together a minus
bi and the complex</p>
<p t="1157000" d="4140">number cosine theta plus i sine
theta.</p>
<p t="1161140" d="3125">There are different ways of</p>
<p t="1164265" d="4610">explaining why I want to put the
minus i there instead of i.</p>
<p t="1168875" d="4843">But, the simplest is because I
want, when I take the real part,</p>
<p t="1173718" d="3867">to get the left-hand side.
I will.</p>
<p t="1177585" d="4765">If I take the real part of
this, I'm going to get a cosine</p>
<p t="1182350" d="4514">theta plus b sine theta</p>
<p t="1186864" d="4264">because of negative i and i make
one,</p>
<p t="1191128" d="4264">multiplied together.
All right, that's the left-hand</p>
<p t="1195392" d="2842">side.
And now, the right-hand side,</p>
<p t="1198234" d="4766">I'm going to use polar
representation instead.</p>
<p t="1203000" d="3394">What's the polar representation
of this guy?</p>
<p t="1206394" d="2763">Well, if &lt;a,
b&gt; has the angle theta,</p>
<p t="1209157" d="4658">then a negative b,
a minus bi goes down</p>
<p t="1213815" d="2606">below.
It has the angle minus phi.</p>
<p t="1216421" d="2052">So, this is,
has magnitude.</p>
<p t="1218473" d="4579">It is polar representation.
Its magnitude is a squared plus</p>
<p t="1223052" d="4263">b squared,
and its angle is negative phi,</p>
<p t="1227315" d="4816">not positive phi because this a
minus bi goes below</p>
<p t="1232131" d="3869">the axis if a and b are
positive.</p>
<p t="1236000" d="3246">So, it's e to the minus i phi.</p>
<p t="1239246" d="3764">That's the first guy.
And, how about the second guy?</p>
<p t="1243010" d="4132">Well, the second guy is e to
the i theta.</p>
<p t="1247142" d="3985">So, what's the product?
It is a squared plus b squared,</p>
<p t="1251127" d="3320">the square root,
times e to the i times (theta</p>
<p t="1254447" d="3690">minus phi).</p>
<p t="1258137" d="3394">And now, what do I want?
The real part of this,</p>
<p t="1261531" d="3469">and I want the real part of
this.</p>
<p t="1265000" d="3321">So, let's just say take the
real parts of both sides.</p>
<p t="1268321" d="2875">If I take the real part of the
left-hand side,</p>
<p t="1271196" d="3577">I get a cosine theta plus b
sine theta.</p>
<p t="1274773" d="2684">If I take a real part of this</p>
<p t="1277457" d="3769">side, I get square root of a
squared plus b squared times e,</p>
<p t="1281226" d="2427">times the cosine,
that's the real part,</p>
<p t="1283653" d="3130">right, of theta minus phi,
which is just what it's</p>
<p t="1286783" d="4217">supposed to be.</p>
<p t="1291000" d="4941">Well, with three different
arguments, I'm really pounding</p>
<p t="1295941" d="4941">the table on this formula.
But, I think there's something</p>
<p t="1300882" d="3441">to be learned from at least two
of them.</p>
<p t="1304323" d="3177">And, you know,
I'm still, for awhile,</p>
<p t="1307500" d="4147">I will never miss an
opportunity to bang complex</p>
<p t="1311647" d="3970">numbers into your head because,
in some sense,</p>
<p t="1315617" d="5383">you have to reproduce the
experience of the race.</p>
<p t="1321000" d="3540">As I mentioned in the notes,
it took mathematicians 300 or</p>
<p t="1324540" d="2484">400 years to get used to complex
numbers.</p>
<p t="1327024" d="3976">So, if it takes you three or
four weeks, that's not too bad.</p>
<p t="1352000" d="4395">Now, for the rest of the period
I'd like to go back to the</p>
<p t="1356395" d="3701">linear equations,
and try to put into perspective</p>
<p t="1360096" d="3470">and summarize,
and tell you a couple of things</p>
<p t="1363566" d="3007">which I had to leave out,
but which are,</p>
<p t="1366573" d="2390">in my view, extremely
important.</p>
<p t="1368963" d="3470">And, up to now,
I don't want to leave you with</p>
<p t="1372433" d="4010">any misapprehensions.
So, I'm going to summarize this</p>
<p t="1376443" d="4781">way, whereas last lecture I went
from the most general equation</p>
<p t="1381224" d="5167">to the most special.
I'd like to just write them</p>
<p t="1386391" d="2657">down in the reverse order,
now.</p>
<p t="1389048" d="4164">So, we are talking about basic
linear equations.</p>
<p t="1393212" d="3720">First order,
of course, we haven't moved as</p>
<p t="1396932" d="3897">a second order yet.
So, the most special one,</p>
<p t="1400829" d="5138">and the one we talked about
essentially all of the previous</p>
<p t="1405967" d="4960">two times, or last Friday,
anyway, was the equation where</p>
<p t="1410927" d="3543">the k, the coefficient of y,
is constant,</p>
<p t="1414470" d="4695">and where you also get it on
the right-hand side quite</p>
<p t="1419165" d="4977">providentially.
So, this is the most special</p>
<p t="1424142" d="4363">form, and it's the one which
governed what I will call the</p>
<p t="1428505" d="4745">temperature-concentration model,
or if you want to be grown up,</p>
<p t="1433250" d="4362">the conduction-diffusion model,
conduction-diffusion which</p>
<p t="1437612" d="4209">describes the processes,
which the equation is modeling,</p>
<p t="1441821" d="4133">whereas these simply described
the variables of things,</p>
<p t="1445954" d="4362">which you usually are trying to
calculate when you use the</p>
<p t="1450316" d="3441">equation.
Now, there are a class of</p>
<p t="1453757" d="3868">things where the thing is
constant, but where the k does</p>
<p t="1457625" d="3023">not appear naturally on the
right hand side.</p>
<p t="1460648" d="4289">And, you're going to encounter
them pretty quickly in physics,</p>
<p t="1464937" d="3023">for one place.
So, I better not try to sweep</p>
<p t="1467960" d="4778">those under the rug.
Let's just call that q of t.</p>
<p t="1472738" d="4205">And finally,
there is the most general case,</p>
<p t="1476943" d="3520">where you allow k to be
non-constant.</p>
<p t="1480463" d="5379">That's the one we began,
when we talked about the linear</p>
<p t="1485842" d="3911">equation.
And you know how to solve it in</p>
<p t="1489753" d="4597">general by a definite or an
indefinite integral.</p>
<p t="1494350" d="6650">Now, there's one other thing,
which I want to talk about.</p>
<p t="1501000" d="2727">I will do all these in a
certain order.</p>
<p t="1503727" d="3733">But, from the beginning,
you should keep in mind that</p>
<p t="1507460" d="3087">there's another between the
first two cases.</p>
<p t="1510547" d="3804">Between the first two cases,
there's another extremely</p>
<p t="1514351" d="3733">important distinction,
and that is as to whether k is</p>
<p t="1518084" d="3230">positive or not.
Up to now, we've always had k</p>
<p t="1521314" d="3445">positive.
So, I'm going to put that here.</p>
<p t="1524759" d="5241">So, it's understood when I
write these, that k is positive.</p>
<p t="1530000" d="2291">I want to talk about that,
too.</p>
<p t="1532291" d="4124">But, first things first.
The first thing I wanted to do</p>
<p t="1536415" d="3131">was to show you that this,
the first case,</p>
<p t="1539546" d="3819">the most special case,
does not just apply to this.</p>
<p t="1543365" d="2367">It applies to other things,
too.</p>
<p t="1545732" d="2444">Let me give you a mixing
problem.</p>
<p t="1548176" d="3666">The typical mixing problem
gives another example.</p>
<p t="1551842" d="4048">You've already done in
recitation, and you did one for</p>
<p t="1555890" d="3360">the problem set,
the problem of the two rooms</p>
<p t="1559250" d="4864">filled with smoke.
But, let me do it just using</p>
<p t="1564114" d="4380">letters, so that the ideas stand
out a little more clearly,</p>
<p t="1568494" d="3323">and you are not preoccupied
with the numbers,</p>
<p t="1571817" d="3776">and calculating with the
numbers, and trying to get</p>
<p t="1575593" d="3474">numerical examples.
So, it's as simple as k sub</p>
<p t="1579067" d="1964">mixing.
It looks like this.</p>
<p t="1581031" d="2794">You have a tank,
a room, I don't know,</p>
<p t="1583825" d="2643">where everything's getting
mixed in.</p>
<p t="1586468" d="4532">It has a certain volume,
which I will call v.</p>
<p t="1591000" d="3909">Something is flowing in,
a gas or a liquid.</p>
<p t="1594909" d="4002">And, r will be the flow rate,
in some units.</p>
<p t="1598911" d="5212">Now, since it can't pile up
inside this sealed container,</p>
<p t="1604123" d="4933">which I'm sure is full,
the flow rate out must also be</p>
<p t="1609056" d="2885">r.
And, what we're interested in</p>
<p t="1611941" d="4840">is the amount of salt.
So, x, let's suppose these are</p>
<p t="1616781" d="5770">fluid flows, and the dissolved
substance that I'm talking about</p>
<p t="1622551" d="4375">is not carbon monoxide,
it's salt, any dissolved</p>
<p t="1626926" d="7074">substance, some pollutant or
whatever the problem calls for.</p>
<p t="1634000" d="6806">Let's use salt.
So, it's the amount of salt in</p>
<p t="1640806" d="7261">the tank at time t.
I'm interested in knowing how</p>
<p t="1648067" d="5989">that varies with time.
Now, there's nothing to be said</p>
<p t="1654056" d="2522">about how it flows out.
What flows out,</p>
<p t="1656578" d="2919">of course, is what happens to
be in the tank.</p>
<p t="1659497" d="2322">But, I do have to say what
flows in.</p>
<p t="1661819" d="4181">Now, the only convenient way to
describe the in-flow is in terms</p>
<p t="1666000" d="3317">of its concentration.
The salt will be dissolved in</p>
<p t="1669317" d="3384">the in-flowing water,
and so there will be a certain</p>
<p t="1672701" d="2322">concentration.
And, as you will see,</p>
<p t="1675023" d="3052">for a secret reason,
I'm going to give that the</p>
<p t="1678075" d="4537">subscript e.
So, e is the concentration of</p>
<p t="1682612" d="2973">the incoming salt,
in other words,</p>
<p t="1685585" d="3694">in the fluid,
how many grams are there per</p>
<p t="1689279" d="3964">liter in the incoming fluid.
That's the data.</p>
<p t="1693243" d="3874">So, this is the data.
r is part of the data.</p>
<p t="1697117" d="3153">r is the flow rate.
v is the volume.</p>
<p t="1700270" d="5585">I think I won't bother writing
that down, and the problem is to</p>
<p t="1705855" d="4145">determine what happens to x of
t.</p>
<p t="1710000" d="4603">Now, I strongly recommend you
not attempt to work directly</p>
<p t="1714603" d="4926">with the concentrations unless
you feel you have a really good</p>
<p t="1719529" d="2827">physical feeling for
concentrations.</p>
<p t="1722356" d="4603">I strongly recommend you work
with a variable that you are</p>
<p t="1726959" d="2988">given, namely,
the dependent variable,</p>
<p t="1729947" d="2746">which is the amount of salt,
grams.</p>
<p t="1732693" d="4765">Well, because it's something
you can physically think about.</p>
<p t="1737458" d="2988">It's coming in,
it's getting mixed up,</p>
<p t="1740446" d="8369">and some of it is going out.
So, the basic equation is going</p>
<p t="1748815" d="9786">to be that the rate of change of
salt in the tank is the rate of</p>
<p t="1758601" d="9321">salt inflow, let me write salt
inflow, minus the rate of salt</p>
<p t="1767922" d="5281">outflow.
Okay, at what rate is salt</p>
<p t="1773203" d="5967">flowing in?
Well, the flow rate is the flow</p>
<p t="1779170" d="4500">rate of the liquid.
I multiply the flow rate,</p>
<p t="1783670" d="3886">1 L per minute times the
concentration,</p>
<p t="1787556" d="4091">3 g per liter.
That means 3 g per minute.</p>
<p t="1791647" d="4705">It's going to be,
therefore, the product of the</p>
<p t="1796352" d="6648">flow rate and the concentration,
incoming concentration.</p>
<p t="1803000" d="2798">How about the rate of the salt
outflow?</p>
<p t="1805798" d="3094">Well, again,
the rate of the liquid outflow</p>
<p t="1808892" d="2578">is r.
And, what is the concentration</p>
<p t="1811470" d="3903">of salt in the outflow?
I must use, when you talk flow</p>
<p t="1815373" d="3610">rates, the other factor must be
the concentration,</p>
<p t="1818983" d="3240">not the amount.
So, what is the concentration</p>
<p t="1822223" d="3241">in the outflow?
Well, it's the amount of salt</p>
<p t="1825464" d="3536">in the tank divided by its
volume.</p>
<p t="1829000" d="3828">So, the analog,
the concentration here is x</p>
<p t="1832828" d="3647">divided by v.
Now, here's a typical messy</p>
<p t="1836475" d="4466">equation, dx / dt,
let's write it in the standard,</p>
<p t="1840941" d="3829">linear form,
plus r times x over v equals r</p>
<p t="1844770" d="5288">times the given concentration,
which is a function of time.</p>
<p t="1850058" d="4011">Now, this is going to be some
given function,</p>
<p t="1854069" d="5196">and there will be no reason
whatsoever why you can't solve</p>
<p t="1859265" d="4749">it in that form.
And, that's normally what you</p>
<p t="1864014" d="1390">will do.
Nonetheless,</p>
<p t="1865404" d="3751">in trying to understand how it
fits into this paradigm,</p>
<p t="1869155" d="3682">which kind of equation is it?
Well, clearly there's an</p>
<p t="1872837" d="2918">awkwardness in that on the
right-hand side,</p>
<p t="1875755" d="3335">we have concentration,
and on the left-hand side,</p>
<p t="1879090" d="3752">we seem to have amounts.
Now, the way to understand the</p>
<p t="1882842" d="3334">equation as opposed to the way
to solve it, well,</p>
<p t="1886176" d="2501">it's a step on the way to
solving it.</p>
<p t="1888677" d="3335">But, I emphasize,
you can and normally will solve</p>
<p t="1892012" d="4734">it in exactly that form.
But, to understand what's</p>
<p t="1896746" d="3285">happening, it's better to
express it in terms of</p>
<p t="1900031" d="3703">concentration entirely,
and that's why it's called the</p>
<p t="1903734" d="2167">concentration,
or the diffusion,</p>
<p t="1905901" d="2236">concentration-diffusion
equation.</p>
<p t="1908137" d="3284">So, I'm going to convert this
to concentrations.</p>
<p t="1911421" d="4053">Now, there's no problem here.
x over v is the concentration</p>
<p t="1915474" d="2306">in the tank.
And now, immediately,</p>
<p t="1917780" d="2795">you see, hey,
it looks like it's going to</p>
<p t="1920575" d="5428">come out just in the first form.
But, wait a minute.</p>
<p t="1926003" d="4007">How about the x?
How do I convert that?</p>
<p t="1930010" d="3691">Well, what's the relation
between x?</p>
<p t="1933701" d="6011">So, if the concentration in the
tank is equal to x over v,</p>
<p t="1939712" d="5906">so the tank concentration,
then x is equal to C times the</p>
<p t="1945618" d="5905">constant, V, and dx / dt,
therefore, will be c times dC /</p>
<p t="1951523" d="2964">dt.
You see that?</p>
<p t="1954487" d="3661">Now, that's not in standard
form.</p>
<p t="1958148" d="6521">Let's put it in standard form.
To put it in standard form,</p>
<p t="1964669" d="6407">I see, now, that it's not r
that's the critical quantity.</p>
<p t="1971076" d="4233">It's r divided by v.
So, it's dC / dt,</p>
<p t="1975309" d="4691">C prime, plus r divided by v,
--</p>
<p t="1980000" d="4281">-- I'm going to call that k,
k C, no let's not,</p>
<p t="1984281" d="5491">r divided by v is equal to r
divided by v times Ce.</p>
<p t="1989772" d="4468">That's the equation expressed</p>
<p t="1994240" d="4560">in a form where the
concentration is the dependent</p>
<p t="1998800" d="4375">variable, rather than the amount
of salt itself.</p>
<p t="2003175" d="4654">And, you can see it falls
exactly in this category.</p>
<p t="2007829" d="3257">That means that I can talk
about it.</p>
<p t="2011086" d="5398">The natural way to talk about
this equation is in terms of,</p>
<p t="2016484" d="6516">the same way we talked about
the temperature equation.</p>
<p t="2023000" d="4235">I said concentration.
I mean, that concentration has</p>
<p t="2027235" d="3073">nothing to do with this
concentration.</p>
<p t="2030308" d="4652">This is the diffusion model,
where salt solution outside,</p>
<p t="2034960" d="3571">cell in the middle,
salt diffusing through a</p>
<p t="2038531" d="4485">semi-permeable membrane into
that, uses Newton's law of</p>
<p t="2043016" d="4984">diffusion, except he didn't do a
law of diffusion.</p>
<p t="2048000" d="2663">But, he is sticky.
His name is attached to</p>
<p t="2050663" d="2599">everything.
So, that's this concentration</p>
<p t="2053262" d="2403">model.
It's the one entirely analogous</p>
<p t="2055665" d="3119">to the temperature.
And the physical setup is the</p>
<p t="2058784" d="2338">same.
This one is entirely different.</p>
<p t="2061122" d="3833">Mixing in this form of this
problem has really nothing to do</p>
<p t="2064955" d="2924">with this model whatsoever.
But, nor does that</p>
<p t="2067879" d="3638">concentration had anything to do
with this concentration,</p>
<p t="2071517" d="4483">which refers to the result of
the mixing in the tank.</p>
<p t="2076000" d="4535">But, what happens is the
differential equation is the</p>
<p t="2080535" d="2617">same.
The language of input and</p>
<p t="2083152" d="4536">response that we talked about is
also available here.</p>
<p t="2087688" d="5059">So, everything is the same.
And, the most interesting thing</p>
<p t="2092747" d="4536">is that it shows that the analog
of the conductivity,</p>
<p t="2097283" d="4449">the k, the analog of
conductivity and diffusivity is</p>
<p t="2101732" d="5088">this quantity.
I should not be considering r</p>
<p t="2106820" d="4863">and v by themselves.
I should be considering as the</p>
<p t="2111683" d="3696">basic quantity,
the ratio of those two.</p>
<p t="2115379" d="3890">Now, why is that,
is the basic parameter.</p>
<p t="2119269" d="4279">What is this?
Well, r is the rate of outflow,</p>
<p t="2123548" d="3793">and the rate of inflow,
what's r over v?</p>
<p t="2127341" d="4085">r over v is the fractional rate
of outflow.</p>
<p t="2131426" d="3890">In other words,
if r over v is one tenth,</p>
<p t="2135316" d="5641">it means that 1/10 of the tank
will be emptied in a minute,</p>
<p t="2140957" d="3543">say.
In other words,</p>
<p t="2144500" d="4500">we lumped these two constants
into a single k,</p>
<p t="2149000" d="4599">and at the same time have
simplified the units.</p>
<p t="2153599" d="4500">What are the units?
This is volume per minute.</p>
<p t="2158099" d="4100">This is volume.
So, it's simply reciprocal</p>
<p t="2162199" d="5201">minutes, reciprocal time,
which was the same units of</p>
<p t="2167400" d="3699">that diffusivity and
conductivity had,</p>
<p t="2171099" d="4932">reciprocal time.
The space variables have</p>
<p t="2176031" d="3133">entirely disappeared.
So, it that way,</p>
<p t="2179164" d="3809">it's simplified.
It's simplified conceptually,</p>
<p t="2182973" d="4910">and now, you can answer the
same type of questions we asked</p>
<p t="2187883" d="4424">before about this.
I think it would be better for</p>
<p t="2192307" d="1616">us to move on,
though.</p>
<p t="2193923" d="3538">Well, just an example,
one really simple thing,</p>
<p t="2197461" d="4462">so, suppose since we spent so
much time worrying about what</p>
<p t="2201923" d="3230">was happening with sinusoid
inputs, I mean,</p>
<p t="2205153" d="3077">when could Ce be sinusoidal,
for example?</p>
<p t="2208230" d="3077">Well, roughly sinusoidal if,
for example,</p>
<p t="2211307" d="3693">some factory were polluting.
If this were a lake,</p>
<p t="2215000" d="4307">and some factory were polluting
it, but in the beginning,</p>
<p t="2219307" d="4154">at the beginning of the day,
they produced a lot of the</p>
<p t="2223461" d="4231">pollutant, and by the end of the
day when it wound down,</p>
<p t="2227692" d="4538">it might well happen that the
concentration of pollutants in</p>
<p t="2232230" d="4385">the incoming stream would vary
sinusoidally with a 24 hour</p>
<p t="2236615" d="5870">cycle.
And then, we would be asking,</p>
<p t="2242485" d="4327">so, suppose this varies
sinusoidally.</p>
<p t="2246812" d="4688">In other words,
it's like cosine omega t.</p>
<p t="2251500" d="5408">I'm asking, how closely does</p>
<p t="2256908" d="7092">the concentration in the tank
follow C sub e?</p>
<p t="2264000" d="4173">Now, what would that depend
upon?</p>
<p t="2268173" d="4174">Think about it.
Well, the answer,</p>
<p t="2272347" d="6522">suppose k is large.
Closely, let's just analyze one</p>
<p t="2278869" d="5052">case, if k is big.
Now, what would make k big?</p>
<p t="2283921" d="2776">We know that from the
temperature thing.</p>
<p t="2286697" d="4199">If the conductivity is high,
then the inner temperature will</p>
<p t="2290896" d="4271">follow the outer temperature
closely, and the same thing with</p>
<p t="2295167" d="2704">the diffusion model.
But we, of course,</p>
<p t="2297871" d="4057">therefore, since the equation
is the same, we must get the</p>
<p t="2301928" d="3132">same result here.
Now, what would make k big?</p>
<p t="2305060" d="2989">If r is big,
if the flow rate is very fast,</p>
<p t="2308049" d="3417">we will expect the
concentration of the inside of</p>
<p t="2311466" d="4057">that tank to match fairly
closely the concentration of the</p>
<p t="2315523" d="3131">pollutant, of the incoming salt
solution, or,</p>
<p t="2318654" d="4828">if the tank is very small.
For fixed flow rates,</p>
<p t="2323482" d="3670">if the tank is very small,
well, then it gets emptied</p>
<p t="2327152" d="2118">quickly.
So, both of these are,</p>
<p t="2329270" d="2965">I think, intuitive results.
And, of course,</p>
<p t="2332235" d="4023">as before, we got them from
that, by trying to analyze the</p>
<p t="2336258" d="2965">final form of the solution.
In other words,</p>
<p t="2339223" d="4235">we got them by looking at that
form of the solution up there,</p>
<p t="2343458" d="3784">and seeing if k is big.
As k increases,</p>
<p t="2347242" d="4886">what happens to the amplitude,
and what happens to the phase</p>
<p t="2352128" d="2733">lag?
But, that summarizes the two.</p>
<p t="2354861" d="2402">So, this means,
closely means,</p>
<p t="2357263" d="2899">that the phase lag is,
big or small?</p>
<p t="2360162" d="3230">The lag is small.
And, the amplitude is,</p>
<p t="2363392" d="4224">well, the amplitude,
the biggest the amplitude could</p>
<p t="2367616" d="5384">ever be is one because that's
the amplitude of this.</p>
<p t="2373000" d="5020">So, the amplitude is near one,
one because that's the</p>
<p t="2378020" d="3766">amplitude of the incoming
signal, input,</p>
<p t="2381786" d="5503">whatever you want to call it.
Okay, now, I'd like to spend</p>
<p t="2387289" d="5407">the rest of the time talking
about the failures of number</p>
<p t="2392696" d="5890">one, and when you have to use
number two, and when even number</p>
<p t="2398586" d="5295">two is no good.
So, let me end first-order</p>
<p t="2403881" d="4655">equations by putting my worst
foot forward.</p>
<p t="2408536" d="5208">Well, I'm just trying to avoid
disappointment at</p>
<p t="2413744" d="6207">misapprehensions from you.
I'll watch you leave this room</p>
<p t="2419951" d="2992">and say, well,
he said that,</p>
<p t="2422943" d="3879">okay.
So, the first one you're going</p>
<p t="2426822" d="5763">to encounter very shortly where
one is not satisfied,</p>
<p t="2432585" d="5541">but two is, so on some examples
where you need two,</p>
<p t="2438126" d="5874">well, it's going to happen
right here.</p>
<p t="2444000" d="3634">Somebody, sooner or later,
it's going to draw on that</p>
<p t="2447634" d="3005">loathsome orange chalk,
which is unerasable,</p>
<p t="2450639" d="2167">something which looks like
that.</p>
<p t="2452806" d="2167">Remember, you saw it here
first.</p>
<p t="2454973" d="3354">r, yeah, we had that.
Okay, see, I had it in high</p>
<p t="2458327" d="2377">school too.
That's the capacitance.</p>
<p t="2460704" d="3774">This is the resistance.
That's the electromotive force:</p>
<p t="2464478" d="3005">battery, or a source of
alternating current,</p>
<p t="2467483" d="3775">something like that.
Now, of course,</p>
<p t="2471258" d="4696">what you're interested in is
how the current flows in the</p>
<p t="2475954" d="2684">circuit.
Since current across the</p>
<p t="2478638" d="4781">capacitance doesn't make sense,
you have to talk about the</p>
<p t="2483419" d="4361">charge on the capacitance.
So, q, it's customary in a</p>
<p t="2487780" d="4445">circle this simple to use as the
variable not current,</p>
<p t="2492225" d="3775">but the charge on the
capacitance.</p>
<p t="2496000" d="4642">And then Kirchhoff's,
you are also supposed to know</p>
<p t="2500642" d="4550">that the derivative,
that the time derivative of q</p>
<p t="2505192" d="3993">is what's called the current in
the circuit.</p>
<p t="2509185" d="4550">That sort of intuitive.
But, i in a physics class,</p>
<p t="2513735" d="4179">j in an electrical engineering
class, and why,</p>
<p t="2517914" d="4086">not the letter Y,
but why is that?</p>
<p t="2522000" d="4973">That's because of electrical
engineers use lots of lots of</p>
<p t="2526973" d="4973">complex numbers and therefore,
you have to call current j,</p>
<p t="2531946" d="3228">I guess.
I think they do j in physics,</p>
<p t="2535174" d="2356">too, now.
No, no they don't.</p>
<p t="2537530" d="3664">I don't know.
So, i is ambiguous if you are</p>
<p t="2541194" d="4624">in that particular subject.
And it's customary to use,</p>
<p t="2545818" d="3971">I don't know.
Now it's completely safe.</p>
<p t="2549789" d="2577">Okay, where are we?
Well, the law is,</p>
<p t="2552366" d="4151">the basic differential equation
is Kirchhoff's voltage law,</p>
<p t="2556517" d="4080">but the sum of the voltage
drops across these three has to</p>
<p t="2560597" d="1933">be zero.
So, it's R times i,</p>
<p t="2562530" d="2434">which is dq / dt.
That's Ohm's law.</p>
<p t="2564964" d="2934">That's the voltage drop across
resistance.</p>
<p t="2567898" d="4009">The voltage drop across the
capacitance is Coulomb's law,</p>
<p t="2571907" d="3292">one form of Coulomb's law.
It's q divided by C.</p>
<p t="2575199" d="2577">And, that has to be the voltage
drop.</p>
<p t="2577776" d="4224">And then, there is some sign
convention.</p>
<p t="2582000" d="4454">So, this is either plus or
minus, depending on your sign</p>
<p t="2586454" d="4779">conventions, but it's E of t.
Now, if I put that in standard</p>
<p t="2591233" d="4536">form, in standard form I
probably should say q prime plus</p>
<p t="2595769" d="2673">q over RC equals,
well, I suppose,</p>
<p t="2598442" d="4779">E over R.
And, this is what would appear</p>
<p t="2603221" d="3321">in the equation.
But, it's not the natural</p>
<p t="2606542" d="3553">thing.
The k is one over RC.</p>
<p t="2610095" d="2235">And, that's the reciprocal.</p>
<p t="2612330" d="3563">The RC constant is what
everybody knows is important</p>
<p t="2615893" d="3423">when you talk about a little
circuit of that form.</p>
<p t="2619316" d="2654">On the other hand,
the right-hand side,</p>
<p t="2621970" d="4052">it's quite unnatural to try to
stick in the right-hand side</p>
<p t="2626022" d="2375">that same RC.
Call this EC over RC.</p>
<p t="2628397" d="2444">People don't do that,
and therefore,</p>
<p t="2630841" d="4401">it doesn't really fall into the
paradigm of that first equation.</p>
<p t="2635242" d="4191">It's the second equation that
really falls into the category.</p>
<p t="2639433" d="3214">Another simple example of this
is chained to k,</p>
<p t="2642647" d="5829">radioactively changed to k.
Well, let's say the radioactive</p>
<p t="2648476" d="1997">substance, A,
decays into,</p>
<p t="2650473" d="4474">let's say, one atom of this
produces one atom of that for</p>
<p t="2654947" d="2557">simplicity.
So, it decays into B,</p>
<p t="2657504" d="3994">which then still is radioactive
and decays further.</p>
<p t="2661498" d="4794">Okay, what's the differential
equation, which is going to be,</p>
<p t="2666292" d="2796">it's going to govern this
situation?</p>
<p t="2669088" d="5912">What I want to know is how much
B there is at any given time.</p>
<p t="2675000" d="4217">So, I want a differential
equation for the quantity of the</p>
<p t="2679217" d="2738">radioactive product at any given
time.</p>
<p t="2681955" d="2515">Well, what's it going to look
like?</p>
<p t="2684470" d="4292">Well, it's the amount coming in
minus the amount going out,</p>
<p t="2688762" d="2959">so to speak.
The rate of inflow minus the</p>
<p t="2691721" d="3330">rate of outflow,
except it's not the same type</p>
<p t="2695051" d="4144">of physical flow we had before.
How fast is it coming in?</p>
<p t="2699195" d="2737">Well, A is decaying at a
certain rate,</p>
<p t="2701932" d="3552">and so the rate at which A
decays is by the basic</p>
<p t="2705484" d="4134">radioactive law.
It's k1, it's constant,</p>
<p t="2709618" d="3095">decay constant,
times the amount of A present.</p>
<p t="2712713" d="2462">If I used the differential</p>
<p t="2715175" d="3659">equation with A here,
I'd have to put a negative sign</p>
<p t="2718834" d="3799">because it's the rate at which
that stuff is leaving A.</p>
<p t="2722633" d="4221">But, I'm interested in the rate
at which it's coming in to B.</p>
<p t="2726854" d="3939">So, it has a positive sign.
And then, the rate at which B</p>
<p t="2730793" d="4011">is decaying, and therefore the
quantity of good B is gone,</p>
<p t="2734804" d="3584">--
-- that will have some other</p>
<p t="2738388" d="3582">constant, B.
So, that will be the equation,</p>
<p t="2741970" d="4435">and to avoid having two
dependent variables in there,</p>
<p t="2746405" d="3242">we know how A is decaying.
So, it's k1,</p>
<p t="2749647" d="4008">some constant times A,
sorry, A will be e to the</p>
<p t="2753655" d="2815">negative, you know,
the decay law,</p>
<p t="2756470" d="4862">so, times the initial amount
that was there times e to the</p>
<p t="2761332" d="6183">negative k1 t.
That's how much A there is at</p>
<p t="2767515" d="3037">any given time.
It's decaying by the</p>
<p t="2770552" d="3731">radioactive decay law,
minus k2 B.</p>
<p t="2774283" d="4598">Okay, so how does the
differential equation look like?</p>
<p t="2778881" d="4598">It looks like B prime plus k2 B
equals an exponential,</p>
<p t="2783479" d="4945">k1 A zero e to the negative k1
t.</p>
<p t="2788424" d="2603">But, there's no reason to</p>
<p t="2791027" d="5119">expect that that constant really
has anything to do with k2.</p>
<p t="2796146" d="5032">It's unnatural to put it in
that form, which is the correct</p>
<p t="2801178" d="8477">one.
Now, in the last two minutes,</p>
<p t="2809655" d="13312">I wish to alienate half the
class by pointing out that if k</p>
<p t="2822967" d="10098">is less than zero,
none of the terminology of</p>
<p t="2833065" d="11935">transient, steady-state input
response applies.</p>
<p t="2845000" d="3205">The technique of solving the
equation is identical.</p>
<p t="2848205" d="5175">But, you cannot interpret.
So, the technique is the same,</p>
<p t="2853380" d="3718">and therefore it's worth
learning.</p>
<p t="2857098" d="4620">The technique is the same.
In other words,</p>
<p t="2861718" d="6986">the solution will be still e to
the negative kt integral q of t</p>
<p t="2868704" d="6197">e to the kt dt plus</p>
<p t="2874901" d="5521">a constant times e to the k,
oh, this is terrible,</p>
<p t="2880422" d="4287">no.
dy / dt, let's give an example.</p>
<p t="2884709" d="5332">The equation I'm going to look
at is something that looks like</p>
<p t="2890041" d="3321">this: y equals q of t,
let's say, okay,</p>
<p t="2893362" d="3671">a constant, but the constant a
is positive.</p>
<p t="2897033" d="2884">So, the constant here is
negative.</p>
<p t="2899917" d="3496">Then, when I solve,
my k, in other words,</p>
<p t="2903413" d="3234">is now properly written as
negative a.</p>
<p t="2906647" d="3846">And therefore,
this formula should now become</p>
<p t="2910493" d="5507">not this, but the negative k is
a t.</p>
<p t="2916000" d="5092">And, here it's negative a t.
And, here it is positive a t.</p>
<p t="2921092" d="3664">Now, why is it,
if this is going to be the</p>
<p t="2924756" d="4735">solution, why are all those
things totally irrelevant?</p>
<p t="2929491" d="5271">This is not a transient any
longer because if a is positive,</p>
<p t="2934762" d="4646">this goes to infinity.
Or, if I go to minus infinity,</p>
<p t="2939408" d="4125">then C is negative.
So, it's not transient.</p>
<p t="2943533" d="3467">It's not going to zero,
and it depends heavily on the</p>
<p t="2947000" d="3133">initial conditions.
That means that of these two</p>
<p t="2950133" d="2400">functions, this is the important
guy.</p>
<p t="2952533" d="2600">This is just fixed,
some fixed function.</p>
<p t="2955133" d="3600">Everything, in other words,
is going to depend upon the</p>
<p t="2958733" d="3200">initial conditions,
whereas in the other cases we</p>
<p t="2961933" d="3266">have been studying,
the initial conditions after a</p>
<p t="2965199" d="5310">while don't matter anymore.
Now, why did I say I would</p>
<p t="2970509" d="4924">alienate half of you?
Well, because in what subjects</p>
<p t="2975433" d="4344">will a be positive?
In what subjects will k be</p>
<p t="2979777" d="3378">negative?
k is typically negative in</p>
<p t="2983155" d="2414">biology, economics,
Sloan.</p>
<p t="2985569" d="4440">In other words,
the simple thing is think of it</p>
<p t="2990009" d="3765">in biology.
What's the simplest equation</p>
<p t="2993774" d="4634">for population growth?
Well, it is dP / dt equals</p>
<p t="2998408" d="4344">some, if the population is
growing, a times P,</p>
<p t="3002752" d="7230">and a is a positive number.
That means P prime minus a P is</p>
<p t="3009982" d="3272">zero.
So, the thing I want to leave</p>
<p t="3013254" d="3560">you with is this.
If life is involved,</p>
<p t="3016814" d="5293">k is likely to be negative.
k is positive when inanimate</p>
<p t="3022107" d="3560">things are involved;
I won't say dead,</p>
<p t="3025667" d="1000">inanimate.</p>
