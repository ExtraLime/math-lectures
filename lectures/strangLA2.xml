<p t="0" d="12050">2 times this equation, Okay.</p>
<p t="12050" d="1460">This is it.</p>
<p t="13510" d="3850">The second lecture
in linear algebra,</p>
<p t="17360" d="8500">and I've put below my
main topics for today.</p>
<p t="25860" d="2410">I put right there a
system of equations</p>
<p t="28270" d="2510">that's going to be our
example to work with.</p>
<p t="30780" d="4370">But what are we
going to do with it?</p>
<p t="35150" d="2390">We're going to solve it.</p>
<p t="37540" d="4360">And the method of solution
will not be determinants.</p>
<p t="41900" d="2660">Determinants are something
that will come later.</p>
<p t="44560" d="3370">The method we'll use
is called elimination.</p>
<p t="47930" d="5700">And it's the way every software
package solves equations.</p>
<p t="57960" d="5400">And elimination, well, if it
succeeds, it gets the answer.</p>
<p t="63360" d="2510">And normally it does succeed.</p>
<p t="65870" d="3920">If the matrix A that's
coming into that system</p>
<p t="69790" d="2670">is a good matrix, and
I think this one is,</p>
<p t="72460" d="2310">then elimination will work.</p>
<p t="74770" d="3520">We'll get the answer
in an efficient way.</p>
<p t="78290" d="3020">But why don't we, as long
as we're sort of seeing how</p>
<p t="81310" d="3810">elimination works -- it's
always good to ask how could it</p>
<p t="85120" d="890">fail?</p>
<p t="86010" d="3170">So at the same
time, we'll see how</p>
<p t="89180" d="3390">elimination decides whether
the matrix is a good one</p>
<p t="92570" d="2470">or has problems.</p>
<p t="95040" d="1990">Then to complete
the answer, there's</p>
<p t="97030" d="3750">an obvious step of
back substitution.</p>
<p t="100780" d="3820">In fact, the idea
of elimination is --</p>
<p t="104600" d="3150">you would have
thought of it, right?</p>
<p t="107750" d="3340">I mean Gauss thought
of it before we did,</p>
<p t="111090" d="3050">but only because he
was born earlier.</p>
<p t="114140" d="3930">It's a natural idea...</p>
<p t="118070" d="1950">and died earlier, too.</p>
<p t="120020" d="7000">Okay, and you've seen the idea.</p>
<p t="127020" d="4850">But now, the part that I want
to show you is elimination</p>
<p t="131870" d="4170">expressed in matrix language,
because the whole course --</p>
<p t="136040" d="5700">all the key ideas get expressed
as matrix operations, not as</p>
<p t="141740" d="1680">words.</p>
<p t="143420" d="3660">And one of the operations,
of course, that we'll meet</p>
<p t="147080" d="3420">is how do we multiply
matrices and why?</p>
<p t="150500" d="3650">Okay, so there's a
system of equations.</p>
<p t="154150" d="4120">Three equations
and three unknowns.</p>
<p t="158270" d="4430">And there's the matrix, the
three by three matrix --</p>
<p t="162700" d="5160">so this is the system Ax = b.</p>
<p t="167860" d="3400">This is our system
to solve, Ax equal --</p>
<p t="171260" d="4000">and the right-hand side
is that vector 2, 12, 2.</p>
<p t="175260" d="1710">Okay.</p>
<p t="176970" d="3670">Now, when I describe
elimination --</p>
<p t="180640" d="3660">it gets to be a pain to
keep writing the equal signs</p>
<p t="184300" d="2030">and the pluses and so on.</p>
<p t="186330" d="3890">It's that matrix
that totally matters.</p>
<p t="190220" d="2120">Everything is in that matrix.</p>
<p t="192340" d="2480">But behind it is
those equations.</p>
<p t="194820" d="2564">So what does elimination do?</p>
<p t="197384" d="1541">What's the first
step of elimination?</p>
<p t="202680" d="3430">We accept the first
equation, it's okay.</p>
<p t="206110" d="3110">I'm going to multiply that
equation by the right number,</p>
<p t="209220" d="3760">the right multiplier and
I'm going to subtract it</p>
<p t="212980" d="3240">from the second equation.</p>
<p t="216220" d="1180">With what purpose?</p>
<p t="217400" d="4130">So that will decide what
the multiplier should be.</p>
<p t="221530" d="8650">Our purpose is to knock out
the x part of equation two.</p>
<p t="230180" d="4800">So our purpose is
to eliminate x.</p>
<p t="234980" d="2840">So what do I multiply --</p>
<p t="237820" d="1830">and again, I'll do
it with this matrix,</p>
<p t="239650" d="1940">because I can do it short.</p>
<p t="241590" d="1750">What's the multiplier here?</p>
<p t="243340" d="3430">What do I multiply --
equation one and subtract.</p>
<p t="246770" d="2040">Notice I'm saying
that word subtract.</p>
<p t="248810" d="2060">I'd like to stick
to that convention.</p>
<p t="250870" d="3020">I'll do a subtraction.</p>
<p t="253890" d="5900">First of all this is the key
number that I'm starting with.</p>
<p t="259790" d="2380">And that's called the pivot.</p>
<p t="262170" d="3100">I'll put a box around it
and write its name down.</p>
<p t="265270" d="2530">That's the first pivot.</p>
<p t="267800" d="2841">The first pivot.</p>
<p t="270641" d="499">Okay.</p>
<p t="271140" d="1990">So I'm going to use --</p>
<p t="273130" d="2580">that's sort of like the key
number in that equation.</p>
<p t="275710" d="1550">And now what's the multiplier?</p>
<p t="277260" d="2460">So I'm going to --</p>
<p t="279720" d="6230">my first row won't change,
that's the pivot row.</p>
<p t="285950" d="2730">But I'm going to use it --</p>
<p t="288680" d="3020">and now, finally, let me ask
you what the multiplier is.</p>
<p t="291700" d="980">Yes?</p>
<p t="292680" d="5490">3 times that first equation
will knock out that 3.</p>
<p t="298170" d="940">Okay.</p>
<p t="299110" d="1110">So what will it leave?</p>
<p t="300220" d="1780">So the multiplier is 3.</p>
<p t="302000" d="3220">3 times that will make that 0.</p>
<p t="305220" d="1500">That was our purpose.</p>
<p t="306720" d="4770">3 2s away from the 8 will leave
a 2 and three 1s away from 1</p>
<p t="311490" d="1470">will leave a minus 2.</p>
<p t="312960" d="2440">And this guy didn't change.</p>
<p t="317980" d="4550">Now the next step -- this is
forward elimination and that</p>
<p t="322530" d="1272">Okay. step's completed.</p>
<p t="323802" d="2458">Oh, well, you could say wait
a minute, what about the right</p>
<p t="326260" d="1020">hand side?</p>
<p t="327280" d="5330">Shall I carry -- the right-hand
side gets carried along.</p>
<p t="332610" d="3800">Actually MatLab finishes up
with the left side before --</p>
<p t="336410" d="1920">and then just goes back
to do the right side.</p>
<p t="338330" d="4010">Maybe I'll be MatLab for
a moment and do that.</p>
<p t="342340" d="2270">Okay.</p>
<p t="344610" d="4860">I'm leaving a room for a column
of b, the right-hand side.</p>
<p t="349470" d="1840">But I'll fill it in later.</p>
<p t="351310" d="1050">Okay.</p>
<p t="352360" d="2320">Now the next step of
elimination is what?</p>
<p t="354680" d="2170">Well, strictly speaking...</p>
<p t="356850" d="8400">this position that I cleaned
up was like the 2, 1 position,</p>
<p t="365250" d="2220">row 2, column 1.</p>
<p t="367470" d="2840">So I got a 0 in
the 2, 1 position.</p>
<p t="370310" d="3680">I'll use 2,1 as the
index of that step.</p>
<p t="373990" d="3060">The next step should
be to finish the column</p>
<p t="377050" d="3720">and get a 0 in that position.</p>
<p t="380770" d="3580">So the next step is really
the 3,1 step, row three,</p>
<p t="384350" d="980">column one.</p>
<p t="385330" d="5060">But of course, I already have 0.</p>
<p t="390390" d="680">Okay.</p>
<p t="391070" d="1860">So the multiplier is 0.</p>
<p t="392930" d="6460">I take 0 of this equation away
from this one and I'm all set.</p>
<p t="399390" d="4550">So I won't repeat that, but
there was a step there which,</p>
<p t="403940" d="4810">MatLab would have to look --
it would look at this number</p>
<p t="408750" d="4620">and, do that step, unless you
told it in advance that it was</p>
<p t="413370" d="500">0.</p>
<p t="413870" d="720">Okay.</p>
<p t="414590" d="1940">Now what?</p>
<p t="416530" d="4390">Now we can see the second
pivot, which is what?</p>
<p t="420920" d="3780">The second pivot --
see, we've eliminated --</p>
<p t="424700" d="2170">x is now gone from
this equation, right?</p>
<p t="426870" d="5700">We're down to two
equations in y and z.</p>
<p t="432570" d="1690">And so now I just do it again.</p>
<p t="434260" d="3010">Like, everything's very cursive
at this -- this is like --</p>
<p t="437270" d="2970">such a basic algorithm
and you've seen it,</p>
<p t="440240" d="5430">but carry me through
one last step.</p>
<p t="445670" d="2820">So this is still
the first pivot.</p>
<p t="448490" d="3570">Now the second pivot is this
guy, who has appeared there.</p>
<p t="452060" d="4560">And what's the multiplier, the
appropriate multiplier now?</p>
<p t="456620" d="1510">And what's my purpose?</p>
<p t="458130" d="6430">Is it to wipe out the
3, 2 position, right?</p>
<p t="464560" d="3080">This was the 2, 1 step.</p>
<p t="467640" d="5370">And now I'm going to
take the 3, 2 step.</p>
<p t="473010" d="7340">So this all stays the
same, 1 2 1, 0 2 -1</p>
<p t="480350" d="2990">and the pivots are there.</p>
<p t="483340" d="2170">Now I'm using this pivot,
so what's the multiplier?</p>
<p t="490840" d="3790">this row, gets subtracted from
this row and makes that a 0.</p>
<p t="494630" d="6140">So it's 0, 0 and is it a 5?</p>
<p t="500770" d="3430">Yeah, I guess it's
a 5, is that right?</p>
<p t="504200" d="2360">Because I have a
one there and I'm</p>
<p t="506560" d="5770">subtracting twice of twice
this, so I think it's a 5 there.</p>
<p t="512330" d="1040">There's the third pivot.</p>
<p t="513370" d="2504">So let me put a box
around all three pivots.</p>
<p t="521370" d="7530">Is there a -- oh, did I
just invent a negative one?</p>
<p t="528900" d="4900">I'm sorry that the tape
can't, correct that</p>
<p t="533800" d="1420">as easily as I can.</p>
<p t="535220" d="530">Okay.</p>
<p t="535750" d="1933">Thank you very much.</p>
<p t="540860" d="2750">You get an A in the course now.</p>
<p t="543610" d="960">Is that correct?</p>
<p t="547600" d="2190">Is it correct now?</p>
<p t="549790" d="1020">Okay.</p>
<p t="550810" d="5020">So the three pivots are there --</p>
<p t="555830" d="4010">I know right away a
lot about this matrix.</p>
<p t="559840" d="4560">This elimination step from A --
this matrix I'm going to call</p>
<p t="564400" d="3430">U. U for upper triangular.</p>
<p t="567830" d="1860">So the whole purpose
of elimination</p>
<p t="569690" d="2370">was to get from A to U.</p>
<p t="572060" d="3770">And, literally, that's the
most common calculation</p>
<p t="575830" d="2750">in scientific computing.</p>
<p t="578580" d="2210">And people think of how
could I do that faster?</p>
<p t="580790" d="3420">Because it's a
major, major thing.</p>
<p t="584210" d="3350">But we're doing it the
straightforward way.</p>
<p t="587560" d="4440">We found three pivots, and by
the way, I didn't say this,</p>
<p t="592000" d="2410">pivots can't be 0.</p>
<p t="594410" d="2750">I don't accept 0 as a pivot.</p>
<p t="597160" d="1590">And I didn't get 0.</p>
<p t="598750" d="1900">So this matrix is great.</p>
<p t="600650" d="2500">It gave me three
pivots, I didn't</p>
<p t="603150" d="4300">have to do anything special,
I just followed the rules and,</p>
<p t="607450" d="3680">and the pivots are 1, 2 and 5.</p>
<p t="611130" d="3750">By the way, just because I
always anticipate stuff from</p>
<p t="614880" d="5240">a later day, if I wanted to know
the determinant of this matrix</p>
<p t="620120" d="1890">-- which I never
do want to know,</p>
<p t="622010" d="1980">but I would just
multiply the pivots.</p>
<p t="623990" d="1550">The determinant is 10.</p>
<p t="625540" d="7280">So even things like the
determinant are here.</p>
<p t="632820" d="2140">Okay.</p>
<p t="634960" d="3450">Now -- oh, let me talk
about failure for a moment,</p>
<p t="638410" d="2100">and then --</p>
<p t="640510" d="3860">and then come back to success.</p>
<p t="644370" d="3330">How could this have failed?</p>
<p t="647700" d="6825">How could -- by fail, I mean
to come up with three pivots.</p>
<p t="658570" d="2230">I mean, there are
a couple of points.</p>
<p t="660800" d="1730">I would have already
been in trouble</p>
<p t="662530" d="3990">if this very first
number here was 0.</p>
<p t="666520" d="4090">If it was a 0 there --
suppose that had been a 0,</p>
<p t="670610" d="4150">there were no Xs in that
equation -- first equation.</p>
<p t="674760" d="2280">Does that mean I can't
solve the problem?</p>
<p t="677040" d="2140">Does that mean I quit?</p>
<p t="679180" d="2520">No.</p>
<p t="681700" d="1160">What do I do?</p>
<p t="682860" d="1710">I switch rows.</p>
<p t="684570" d="1440">I exchange rows.</p>
<p t="686010" d="4200">So in case of a 0, I
will not say 0 pivot.</p>
<p t="690210" d="3470">I will never be heard to
utter those words, 0 pivot.</p>
<p t="693680" d="3590">But if there's a 0 in
the pivot position,</p>
<p t="697270" d="2660">maybe I can say
that, I would try</p>
<p t="699930" d="5470">to exchange for a lower equation
and get a proper pivot up</p>
<p t="705400" d="740">there.</p>
<p t="706140" d="500">Okay.</p>
<p t="706640" d="4380">Now, for example, this
second pivot came out two.</p>
<p t="711020" d="1490">Could it have come out 0?</p>
<p t="712510" d="3600">What -- actually, if I
change that 8 a little bit,</p>
<p t="716110" d="5540">I would have got
a little trouble.</p>
<p t="721650" d="6560">What should I change that 8
to so that I run into trouble?</p>
<p t="728210" d="860">A 6.</p>
<p t="729070" d="5770">If that had been a 6, then
this would have been 0</p>
<p t="734840" d="2480">and I couldn't have
used that as the pivot.</p>
<p t="737320" d="2910">But I could have
exchanged again.</p>
<p t="740230" d="1730">In this case.</p>
<p t="741960" d="4880">In this case, because when
can I get out of trouble?</p>
<p t="746840" d="1650">I can get out of
trouble if there's</p>
<p t="748490" d="4090">a non-0 below this
troublesome 0.</p>
<p t="752580" d="1770">And there is here.</p>
<p t="754350" d="2540">So I would be okay in this case.</p>
<p t="756890" d="3190">If this was a 6, I
would survive by a row</p>
<p t="760080" d="1210">exchange.</p>
<p t="761290" d="5140">Now -- of course, it might have
happened that I couldn't do</p>
<p t="766430" d="2850">the row, that -- that
there was 0s below it,</p>
<p t="769280" d="1500">but here there wasn't.</p>
<p t="770780" d="4590">Now, I could also have got in
trouble if this number 1 was</p>
<p t="775370" d="3170">a little different.</p>
<p t="778540" d="3720">See, that 1 became a
5, I guess, by the end.</p>
<p t="785040" d="3900">So can you see what
number there would</p>
<p t="788940" d="5190">have got me trouble that I
really couldn't get out of?</p>
<p t="794130" d="1580">Trouble that I
couldn't get out of</p>
<p t="795710" d="7100">would mean if 0 is
in the pivot position</p>
<p t="802810" d="3460">and I've got no
place to exchange.</p>
<p t="806270" d="5700">So there must be some number
which if I had had here</p>
<p t="811970" d="2490">it would have meant failure.</p>
<p t="814460" d="2130">Negative 4, good.</p>
<p t="816590" d="3080">If it was a negative 4 here --
if it happened to be a negative</p>
<p t="819670" d="4230">4, I'll temporarily
put it up here.</p>
<p t="823900" d="3900">If this had been a
negative 4 z, then I</p>
<p t="827800" d="2464">would have gone
through the same steps.</p>
<p t="830264" d="2416">This would have been a minus
4, it still would have been a</p>
<p t="832680" d="1070">minus 4.</p>
<p t="833750" d="4860">But at the last minute
it would have become 0.</p>
<p t="838610" d="3470">And there wouldn't have
been a third pivot.</p>
<p t="842080" d="2710">The matrix would have
not been invertible.</p>
<p t="844790" d="4070">Well, of course, the inverse of
a matrix is coming next week,</p>
<p t="848860" d="2990">but, you've heard these words</p>
<p t="851850" d="740">before.</p>
<p t="852590" d="4350">So, that's how we
identify failure.</p>
<p t="856940" d="3740">There's temporary failure when
we can do a row exchange --</p>
<p t="860680" d="3670">and get out of it, or there's
complete failure when we get</p>
<p t="864350" d="1670">a 0 and --</p>
<p t="866020" d="2260">and there's nothing
below that we can use.</p>
<p t="868280" d="1120">Okay.</p>
<p t="869400" d="1840">Let's stay with --</p>
<p t="871240" d="3140">back to success now.</p>
<p t="874380" d="4640">In fact, I guess the next
topic is back substitution.</p>
<p t="879020" d="1410">So what's back substitution?</p>
<p t="880430" d="6260">Well, now I'd better bring
the right-hand side in.</p>
<p t="886690" d="5350">So what would MatLab do
and what should we do?</p>
<p t="892040" d="3500">Let me bring in the right-hand
side as an extra column.</p>
<p t="895540" d="1180">So there comes B.</p>
<p t="896720" d="8930">So it's 2, 12, I would call
this the augmented matrix.</p>
<p t="905650" d="2620">"Augment" means you've
tacked something on.</p>
<p t="908270" d="3540">I've tacked on
this extra column.</p>
<p t="911810" d="3060">Because, when I'm
working with equations,</p>
<p t="914870" d="3120">I do the same thing
to both sides.</p>
<p t="917990" d="4950">So, at this step, I subtracted 2
of the first equation away from</p>
<p t="922940" d="3970">the second equation so
that this augmented --</p>
<p t="926910" d="5050">I even brought some colored
chalk, but I don't know if it</p>
<p t="931960" d="590">shows up.</p>
<p t="932550" d="3370">So this is like the augmented --</p>
<p t="935920" d="660">no!</p>
<p t="936580" d="2480">Damn, circled the wrong thing.</p>
<p t="939060" d="1960">Okay.</p>
<p t="941020" d="3000">Here is b.</p>
<p t="944020" d="2070">Okay, that's the extra column.</p>
<p t="946090" d="500">Okay.</p>
<p t="946590" d="2790">So what happened to
that extra column,</p>
<p t="949380" d="1790">the right-hand side
of the equations,</p>
<p t="951170" d="1990">when I did the first step?</p>
<p t="953160" d="4160">So that was 3 of this away
from this, so it took --</p>
<p t="957320" d="4890">the 2 stayed the same, but
three 2s got taken away from 12,</p>
<p t="962210" d="2690">leaving 6, and that
2 stayed the same.</p>
<p t="964900" d="4150">So this is how it's
looking halfway along.</p>
<p t="969050" d="2260">And let me just
carry to the end.</p>
<p t="971310" d="5040">The 2 and the 6 stay
the same, but --</p>
<p t="976350" d="2760">what do I have here?</p>
<p t="979110" d="680">Oh, gosh.</p>
<p t="983090" d="790">Help me out, now.</p>
<p t="983880" d="2530">What -- so now I'm --</p>
<p t="986410" d="3150">This is still like
forward elimination.</p>
<p t="989560" d="2870">I got to this point,
which I think is right,</p>
<p t="992430" d="1990">and now what did
I do at this step?</p>
<p t="994420" d="3830">I multiplied that pivot by 2
or that whole equation by 2</p>
<p t="998250" d="2180">and subtracted from
that, so I think</p>
<p t="1000430" d="3190">I take two 6s, which
is 12, away from the 2.</p>
<p t="1003620" d="6010">Do you think minus 10 is
my final right-hand side --</p>
<p t="1009630" d="2310">the right-hand side that
goes with U, and let me</p>
<p t="1011940" d="4880">call that once and
forever the vector c.</p>
<p t="1016820" d="7240">So c is what happens to b,
and U is what happens to A.</p>
<p t="1024060" d="580">Okay.</p>
<p t="1024640" d="4410">There you've seen
elimination clean.</p>
<p t="1029050" d="2269">Okay.</p>
<p t="1031319" d="2981">Oh, what's back substitution?</p>
<p t="1034300" d="2510">So what are my final
equations, then?</p>
<p t="1036810" d="3390">Can I copy these equations?</p>
<p t="1040200" d="14450">x+2y+z=2 is still there and
2y-2z=6 is there, and 5z=-10.</p>
<p t="1054650" d="1600">Okay.</p>
<p t="1056250" d="3870">Those are the equations
that these numbers</p>
<p t="1060120" d="1880">are telling me about.</p>
<p t="1062000" d="4960">Those are the
equations U x equals c.</p>
<p t="1066960" d="3430">Okay, how do I solve them?</p>
<p t="1070390" d="2390">What one do I solve for first?</p>
<p t="1072780" d="1500">z.</p>
<p t="1074280" d="5270">I see immediately that the
correct value of z is negative</p>
<p t="1079550" d="3310">And what do I do next?</p>
<p t="1082860" d="1160">I go back upwards.</p>
<p t="1084020" d="3080">I now know z here.</p>
<p t="1087100" d="5260">So, if z is negative 2,
that's 4 there, is that right?</p>
<p t="1092360" d="5550">And so 2 y plus a 4
is 6, maybe y is 1.</p>
<p t="1097910" d="3160">Going -- this is
back substitution.</p>
<p t="1101070" d="2590">We're doing it on the
fly because it's so easy.</p>
<p t="1103660" d="3460">And then x is --</p>
<p t="1107120" d="4690">so x -- 2y is 2 minus
2, maybe x is 2?</p>
<p t="1118540" d="3040">So you see what back
substitution is.</p>
<p t="1121580" d="4580">It's the simple step solving
the equations in reverse order</p>
<p t="1126160" d="3190">because the system
is triangular.</p>
<p t="1129350" d="990">Okay.</p>
<p t="1130340" d="1670">Good.</p>
<p t="1132010" d="2850">So that's elimination
and back substitution,</p>
<p t="1134860" d="2760">and I kept the
right-hand side along.</p>
<p t="1137620" d="2740">Okay, now what do I --</p>
<p t="1140360" d="3700">that, like, is
first piece of the</p>
<p t="1144060" d="1270">lecture.</p>
<p t="1145330" d="3450">What's the second piece?</p>
<p t="1148780" d="2750">Matrices are going to get in.</p>
<p t="1151530" d="6110">So I wrote stuff with x, y-s
and z-s in there, then I really,</p>
<p t="1157640" d="6420">got the right shorthand, just
writing the matrix entries,</p>
<p t="1164060" d="3920">and now I want to
write the operations</p>
<p t="1167980" d="4100">that I did in matrices, right?</p>
<p t="1172080" d="2110">I've carried the
matrices along, but I</p>
<p t="1174190" d="8670">haven't said the operation
those elimination steps,</p>
<p t="1182860" d="2391">I now want to
express as matrices.</p>
<p t="1185251" d="499">Okay.</p>
<p t="1185750" d="710">Here they come.</p>
<p t="1189570" d="1896">So now this is
elimination matrices.</p>
<p t="1195280" d="2220">Okay.</p>
<p t="1197500" d="5200">Let me take that first step,
which took me from 1 2 1 3 8 1</p>
<p t="1202700" d="3440">0 4 1.</p>
<p t="1209970" d="2340">I want to operate on that --</p>
<p t="1212310" d="3950">I want to do
elimination on that.</p>
<p t="1216260" d="1120">Okay.</p>
<p t="1217380" d="3790">Okay, now I'm
remembering a point</p>
<p t="1221170" d="8220">I want to single out as
especially important.</p>
<p t="1229390" d="3563">Let me move the
board up for that.</p>
<p t="1236600" d="3420">Because when we do matrix
operations, we've got to, like,</p>
<p t="1240020" d="1840">be able to see the big picture.</p>
<p t="1241860" d="500">Okay.</p>
<p t="1242360" d="3930">Last time, I spoke about
the big picture of --</p>
<p t="1246290" d="4090">when I multiply a matrix
by a right-hand side.</p>
<p t="1250380" d="4310">If I have some matrix there
and I multiply it by 3 4 5,</p>
<p t="1254690" d="1230">let's say --</p>
<p t="1255920" d="3600">so here's a matrix --</p>
<p t="1259520" d="2600">what did I say -- well,
I guess I only said it</p>
<p t="1262120" d="4380">on the videotape, but -- do
you remember how I look at that</p>
<p t="1266500" d="1980">matrix multiplication?</p>
<p t="1268480" d="4930">The result of multiplying
a matrix by some vector</p>
<p t="1273410" d="8420">is a combination of the
columns of the matrix.</p>
<p t="1281830" d="2810">It's 3 times the first column.</p>
<p t="1284640" d="8990">It's 3 times column one plus 4
times column two plus 5 times</p>
<p t="1293630" d="820">column three.</p>
<p t="1299760" d="610">Okay.</p>
<p t="1300370" d="3600">I'm going to come back
to that multiple times.</p>
<p t="1303970" d="7460">What I wanted to do now was to
emphasize the parallel thing</p>
<p t="1311430" d="2960">with rows.</p>
<p t="1314390" d="660">Why?</p>
<p t="1315050" d="4570">Because all our operations
here for this two weeks</p>
<p t="1319620" d="4530">of the course are
row operations.</p>
<p t="1324150" d="6120">So this isn't what I
need for row operations.</p>
<p t="1330270" d="1770">Let me do a row operation.</p>
<p t="1332040" d="8340">Suppose I have my matrix
again and suppose I multiply</p>
<p t="1340380" d="3140">on the left by some
-- let's say 1 2 7.</p>
<p t="1348680" d="5180">Again, I'm just, like,
saying what the result is.</p>
<p t="1353860" d="4380">And then we'll say how
matrix multiplication works</p>
<p t="1358240" d="2230">and we'll see that it's true.</p>
<p t="1360470" d="790">Okay.</p>
<p t="1361260" d="4340">But maybe already I'm making --</p>
<p t="1365600" d="4360">I'm sort of bringing up -- the
central idea of linear algebra</p>
<p t="1369960" d="5530">is how these matrices work by
rows as well as by columns.</p>
<p t="1375490" d="500">Okay.</p>
<p t="1375990" d="1740">How does it work by rows?</p>
<p t="1377730" d="7580">What -- so that's a row vector.</p>
<p t="1385310" d="3550">I could say that's a one
by three matrix, a row</p>
<p t="1388860" d="2475">vector multiplying a
three by three matrix.</p>
<p t="1395300" d="2000">What's the output?</p>
<p t="1397300" d="6140">What's the product of
a row times a matrix?</p>
<p t="1403440" d="2820">And -- okay, it's a row.</p>
<p t="1406260" d="2820">A row -- a column --</p>
<p t="1409080" d="500">I'm sorry.</p>
<p t="1409580" d="2110">A matrix times a
column is a column.</p>
<p t="1411690" d="3660">So matrix times a -- yeah.</p>
<p t="1415350" d="6410">Matrix times a
column is a column.</p>
<p t="1421760" d="2320">And we know what column it is.</p>
<p t="1424080" d="3320">Over here, I'm doing
a row times a matrix.</p>
<p t="1427400" d="2100">And what's the answer?</p>
<p t="1429500" d="3760">It's one of that first
row, so it's 1 times --</p>
<p t="1433260" d="11740">1 times row one, plus 2 times
row two plus 7 times row three.</p>
<p t="1445000" d="2810">When -- as we do
matrix multiplication,</p>
<p t="1447810" d="5840">keep your eye on what it's
doing with whole vectors.</p>
<p t="1453650" d="4490">And what it's doing -- what
it's doing in this case is</p>
<p t="1458140" d="2380">it's combining the rows.</p>
<p t="1460520" d="4230">And we have a combination, a
linear combination of the rows.</p>
<p t="1464750" d="1380">Okay, I want to use that.</p>
<p t="1473160" d="5030">Okay, so my question is what's
the matrix that does this first</p>
<p t="1478190" d="5990">step, that takes -- subtracts
3 of equation one from equation</p>
<p t="1484180" d="500">two?</p>
<p t="1484680" d="1870">That's what I want to do.</p>
<p t="1486550" d="2250">So this is going to
be a matrix that's</p>
<p t="1488800" d="14980">going to subtract 3 times
row one from row two,</p>
<p t="1503780" d="1380">and leaves the other rows the</p>
<p t="1505160" d="510">same.</p>
<p t="1505670" d="3480">Just in -- I mean, the
answer is going to be that.</p>
<p t="1509150" d="3450">So whatever matrix this is --</p>
<p t="1512600" d="2850">and you're going to, like,
tell me what matrix will do it,</p>
<p t="1515450" d="4370">it's the matrix that leaves
the first row unchanged,</p>
<p t="1519820" d="3860">leaves the last row unchanged,
but takes 3 of these</p>
<p t="1523680" d="4060">away from this so it puts a 0
there, a 2 there and a minus 2.</p>
<p t="1527740" d="1730">Good.</p>
<p t="1529470" d="1950">What matrix will do it?</p>
<p t="1531420" d="1590">It's these.</p>
<p t="1533010" d="2870">It should be a
pretty simple matrix,</p>
<p t="1535880" d="4480">because we're doing
a very simple step.</p>
<p t="1540360" d="3480">We're just doing this
step that changes row two.</p>
<p t="1543840" d="2220">So actually, row
one is not changing.</p>
<p t="1546060" d="2430">So tell me how the
matrix should begin.</p>
<p t="1551250" d="9880">One -- the first row of
the matrix will be 1 0 0,</p>
<p t="1561130" d="3920">because that's just the right
thing that takes one of that</p>
<p t="1565050" d="2980">row and none of the other
rows, and that's what we want.</p>
<p t="1568030" d="3130">What's the last
row of the matrix?</p>
<p t="1571160" d="5930">0 0 1, because that takes
one of the third row</p>
<p t="1577090" d="1940">and none of the other
rows, that's great.</p>
<p t="1579030" d="1340">Okay.</p>
<p t="1580370" d="4050">Now, suppose I didn't want
to do anything at all.</p>
<p t="1584420" d="3920">Suppose my row -- well, I guess
maybe I had a case here when I</p>
<p t="1588340" d="4740">already had a 0 and,
didn't have to do anything.</p>
<p t="1593080" d="7460">What matrix does nothing, like,
just leaves you where you were?</p>
<p t="1600540" d="1880">If I put in --</p>
<p t="1602420" d="6860">if I put in 0 1 0, that
would be -- that would be --</p>
<p t="1609280" d="3110">that's the matrix -- what's
the name of that matrix?</p>
<p t="1612390" d="2750">The identity matrix, right.</p>
<p t="1615140" d="1580">So it does absolutely nothing.</p>
<p t="1616720" d="2520">It just multiplies everything
and leaves it where it is.</p>
<p t="1619240" d="3880">It's like a one, like the
number one, for matrices.</p>
<p t="1623120" d="3240">But that's not what we want,
because we want to change this</p>
<p t="1626360" d="1740">row to --</p>
<p t="1628100" d="2960">so what's the correct --</p>
<p t="1631060" d="5550">what should I put in
here now to do it right?</p>
<p t="1636610" d="1670">I want to get -- what do I want?</p>
<p t="1638280" d="2380">What I -- I'm after --</p>
<p t="1640660" d="3700">I want 3 of row one
to get subtracted</p>
<p t="1644360" d="850">off.</p>
<p t="1645210" d="7410">So what's the right matrix,
finish that matrix for me.</p>
<p t="1652620" d="3770">Negative 3 goes here?</p>
<p t="1656390" d="1170">And what goes here?</p>
<p t="1657560" d="1160">That 1.</p>
<p t="1658720" d="890">And what goes here?</p>
<p t="1659610" d="1130">The 0.</p>
<p t="1660740" d="2490">That's the good matrix.</p>
<p t="1663230" d="3470">That's the matrix
that takes minus 3</p>
<p t="1666700" d="4100">of row one plus the row two
and gives the new row 2.</p>
<p t="1670800" d="6550">Should we just, like,
check some particular</p>
<p t="1677350" d="780">entry?</p>
<p t="1678130" d="2250">How do I check a
particular entry</p>
<p t="1680380" d="3260">of a matrix in matrix
multiplication?</p>
<p t="1683640" d="5410">Like, suppose I wanted to check
the entry here that's in row</p>
<p t="1689050" d="2800">two, column three.</p>
<p t="1691850" d="4550">So where does the entry in row
two, column three come from?</p>
<p t="1696400" d="3260">I would look at
row two of this guy</p>
<p t="1699660" d="6570">and column three of this
one to get that number.</p>
<p t="1706230" d="3720">That number comes from the
second row and the third column</p>
<p t="1709950" d="4170">and I just take this
dot product minus 3 --</p>
<p t="1714120" d="5240">I'm multiplying -- minus 3
plus 1 and 0 gives the minus 2.</p>
<p t="1719360" d="650">Yeah.</p>
<p t="1720010" d="1630">It works.</p>
<p t="1721640" d="5200">So we got various ways
to multiply matrices now.</p>
<p t="1726840" d="3030">We're sort of,
like -- informally.</p>
<p t="1729870" d="2730">We've got by columns,
we've got -- well,</p>
<p t="1732600" d="4070">we will have by columns,
by rows, by each entry at a</p>
<p t="1736670" d="700">time.</p>
<p t="1737370" d="3990">But it's good to see that
matrix multiplication when one</p>
<p t="1741360" d="2670">of the matrices is so simple.</p>
<p t="1744030" d="4150">So this guy is our
elementary matrix.</p>
<p t="1748180" d="4350">Let's call it E for
elementary or elimination.</p>
<p t="1752530" d="5600">And let me put the indexes 2 1,
because it's the matrix that we</p>
<p t="1758130" d="4250">needed to fix the 2 1 position.</p>
<p t="1762380" d="3410">It's the matrix that we
needed to get this 2 1</p>
<p t="1765790" d="3550">position to be Okay.</p>
<p t="1769340" d="660">Good enough.</p>
<p t="1770000" d="2140">So what do I do next?</p>
<p t="1772140" d="2410">I need another matrix, right?</p>
<p t="1774550" d="2060">I need to --</p>
<p t="1776610" d="2810">there's another step here.</p>
<p t="1779420" d="3910">And I want to express
the whole elimination</p>
<p t="1783330" d="3450">process in matrix language.</p>
<p t="1786780" d="7730">So tell me what -- so next
step, step two, which was what?</p>
<p t="1794510" d="5460">Subtract -- what was -- what
was the actual step that we did?</p>
<p t="1799970" d="3700">I think I subtracted
-- do you remember?</p>
<p t="1803670" d="3060">I had a 2 in the pivot
and a 4 below it,</p>
<p t="1806730" d="4970">so I subtracted two times --</p>
<p t="1811700" d="4990">times row two from row three.</p>
<p t="1816690" d="2180">From row three.</p>
<p t="1818870" d="2170">Tell me the matrix
that will do that.</p>
<p t="1823910" d="2690">And tell me its name.</p>
<p t="1826600" d="4790">Okay, it's going to be E,
for elementary or elimination</p>
<p t="1831390" d="4690">matrix and what's the index
number that I used to tell me</p>
<p t="1836080" d="2510">what E --</p>
<p t="1838590" d="1160">3, 2, right?</p>
<p t="1839750" d="3940">Because it's fixing
this 3 2 position.</p>
<p t="1843690" d="3860">And what's the matrix, now?</p>
<p t="1847550" d="4650">Okay, you remember -- so E 3 2
is supposed to multiply my guy</p>
<p t="1852200" d="6640">that I have and it's supposed
to produce the right result,</p>
<p t="1858840" d="2480">which was -- it leaves -- it's
supposed to leave the first</p>
<p t="1861320" d="4100">row, it's supposed to leave the
second row and it's supposed</p>
<p t="1865420" d="5070">to straighten out that
third row to this.</p>
<p t="1870490" d="2285">And what's the matrix
that does that?</p>
<p t="1875620" d="1200">1 0 0, right?</p>
<p t="1876820" d="4530">Because we don't change the
first row and the next row</p>
<p t="1881350" d="2840">we don't change either,
and the last row</p>
<p t="1884190" d="3050">is the one we do change.</p>
<p t="1887240" d="2490">And what do I do?</p>
<p t="1889730" d="3810">Let's see, I
subtract two times --</p>
<p t="1893540" d="1580">so what's this row?</p>
<p t="1895120" d="1980">What's this here?</p>
<p t="1897100" d="4430">0, right, because the
first row's not involved.</p>
<p t="1901530" d="2990">It's just in the 3 2
position, isn't it?</p>
<p t="1904520" d="5460">This the key number is this
minus the multiplier that goes</p>
<p t="1909980" d="2450">-- sitting there in
that 3 2 position.</p>
<p t="1912430" d="6803">Is it a minus 2 to subtract 2
and then this is a 1 so that --</p>
<p t="1922550" d="4110">the overall effect is to take
minus 2 of this row plus 1 of</p>
<p t="1926660" d="540">that.</p>
<p t="1927200" d="500">Okay.</p>
<p t="1930430" d="4850">So, I've now given you the
pieces, the elimination</p>
<p t="1935280" d="3440">matrices, the elementary
matrices that take each step.</p>
<p t="1941510" d="2380">So now what?</p>
<p t="1943890" d="3620">Now the next point
in the lecture</p>
<p t="1947510" d="4940">is to put those steps together
into a matrix that does it all</p>
<p t="1952450" d="2480">and see how it all happens.</p>
<p t="1954930" d="2290">So now I'm going to
express the whole --</p>
<p t="1957220" d="9310">everything we did today so
far on A was to start with A,</p>
<p t="1966530" d="6620">we multiplied it by E 2 1,
that was the first step --</p>
<p t="1973150" d="7930">and then we multiplied that
result by E 3 2 and that led us</p>
<p t="1981080" d="3890">to this thing and
what was that matrix?</p>
<p t="1984970" d="5920">U.</p>
<p t="1990890" d="2950">You see why I like
matrix notation,</p>
<p t="1993840" d="4910">because there in,
like, little space --</p>
<p t="1998750" d="4710">a few bits when its compressed
on the web -- is everything --</p>
<p t="2003460" d="2030">is this whole lecture.</p>
<p t="2005490" d="1060">Okay.</p>
<p t="2006550" d="7170">Now there -- there are
important facts about matrix</p>
<p t="2013720" d="2220">multiplication.</p>
<p t="2015940" d="4500">And we're close to maybe
the most important.</p>
<p t="2020440" d="1880">And that is this.</p>
<p t="2022320" d="2150">Suppose I ask you this question.</p>
<p t="2024470" d="4670">Suppose I start with
a matrix A and I</p>
<p t="2029140" d="3270">want to end with
a matrix U and I</p>
<p t="2032410" d="2820">want to say what matrix
does the whole job?</p>
<p t="2037750" d="7490">What matrix takes me from A to
U, using the letters I've got?</p>
<p t="2047880" d="2089">And the answer is simple.</p>
<p t="2049969" d="3306">I'm not asking this as --
but it's highly important.</p>
<p t="2057199" d="2230">How would I create
the matrix that</p>
<p t="2059429" d="2210">does the whole job
at once, that does</p>
<p t="2061639" d="3201">all of elimination in one shot?</p>
<p t="2064840" d="970">It would be --</p>
<p t="2065810" d="3679">I would just put
these together, right?</p>
<p t="2069489" d="4821">In other words, this is the
thing I'm struggling to say.</p>
<p t="2074310" d="1500">I can move those parentheses.</p>
<p t="2078699" d="2351">If I keep the
matrices in order --</p>
<p t="2081050" d="3980">I can't mess around with
the order of the matrices,</p>
<p t="2085030" d="4430">but I can change the order
that I do the multiplications.</p>
<p t="2089460" d="3544">I can multiply
these two first --</p>
<p t="2095670" d="3820">in other words, you see what
those parentheses are doing?</p>
<p t="2099490" d="5420">It's saying -- multiply the
Es first and that gives you</p>
<p t="2104910" d="2750">the matrix that does
everything at once.</p>
<p t="2107660" d="1710">Okay.</p>
<p t="2109370" d="4550">So this fact, that this is
automatically the same as this</p>
<p t="2113920" d="950">--</p>
<p t="2114870" d="5720">for every matrix multiplication,
which I'm conscious of still</p>
<p t="2120590" d="4010">not telling you in
every detail, but, like,</p>
<p t="2124600" d="3310">you're seeing how it works --
and this is highly important --</p>
<p t="2127910" d="4240">and maybe tell me the long
word that describes this law</p>
<p t="2132150" d="5470">for matrices, that you
can move the parentheses?</p>
<p t="2137620" d="3050">It's called the associative law.</p>
<p t="2140670" d="1881">I think you can now forget that.</p>
<p t="2145380" d="1940">But don't forget the law.</p>
<p t="2147320" d="2130">I mean, like, forget
the word associative.</p>
<p t="2149450" d="790">I don't know.</p>
<p t="2150240" d="1710">But don't forget the law.</p>
<p t="2151950" d="7590">Because actually, we'll see so
many steps in linear algebra,</p>
<p t="2159540" d="3680">so many proofs,
even, of main fact</p>
<p t="2163220" d="2275">come from just moving
the parentheses.</p>
<p t="2168610" d="6790">And it's not that easy to
prove that this is correct,</p>
<p t="2175400" d="2840">you have to go into the
gory details of matrix</p>
<p t="2178240" d="2460">multiplication, do
it both ways and see</p>
<p t="2180700" d="2660">that you come out the same.</p>
<p t="2183360" d="4000">Maybe I'll leave the
author to do that.</p>
<p t="2187360" d="800">Okay.</p>
<p t="2188160" d="1490">So there we go.</p>
<p t="2194550" d="5610">So there's a single matrix,
I could call it E --</p>
<p t="2200160" d="5620">while we're talking about these
matrices, tell me one other --</p>
<p t="2205780" d="3360">there's another type
of elementary matrix,</p>
<p t="2209140" d="3370">and we already said
why we might need it.</p>
<p t="2212510" d="2010">We didn't need it in this case.</p>
<p t="2214520" d="4060">But it's the matrix
that exchanges two rows.</p>
<p t="2218580" d="3410">It's called a
permutation matrix.</p>
<p t="2221990" d="4510">Can you just, like, tell me what
that would So I'm just -- like,</p>
<p t="2226500" d="3760">this is a slight digression
and be? we'll -- yes,</p>
<p t="2230260" d="2340">so let me get some -- let me
figure out where I'm going</p>
<p t="2232600" d="1370">to put a permutation matrix.</p>
<p t="2236870" d="2250">You'll see I'm always
squeezing stuff in.</p>
<p t="2239120" d="720">So permutation.</p>
<p t="2243270" d="10260">Or, in fact this one you'll,
like, exchange rows --</p>
<p t="2253530" d="4390">shall I exchange rows one and
two, just to make life easy?</p>
<p t="2257920" d="3530">So if I had my matrix -- no, let
-- let me just do two by two.</p>
<p t="2261450" d="2880">|a b; c d|.</p>
<p t="2264330" d="5280">Suppose I want to find
the matrix that exchanges</p>
<p t="2269610" d="720">those rows.</p>
<p t="2275060" d="3290">What is it?</p>
<p t="2278350" d="2910">So the matrix that
exchanges those rows --</p>
<p t="2281260" d="2380">the row I want is
c d and it's there.</p>
<p t="2283640" d="3460">So I better take one of it.</p>
<p t="2287100" d="3910">And the row I want here is up
top, so I'll take one of that.</p>
<p t="2291010" d="2170">So actually, I'm just --</p>
<p t="2293180" d="3670">the easy way -- this is my
matrix that I'll call P,</p>
<p t="2296850" d="900">for permutation.</p>
<p t="2301560" d="5090">It's the matrix -- actually, the
easy way to find it is just do</p>
<p t="2306650" d="3850">the thing to the
identity matrix.</p>
<p t="2310500" d="2150">Exchange the rows of
the identity matrix</p>
<p t="2312650" d="6180">and then that's the matrix that
will do row exchanges for you.</p>
<p t="2318830" d="4170">Suppose I wanted to
exchange columns instead.</p>
<p t="2323000" d="2290">Columns have hardly got
into today's lecture,</p>
<p t="2325290" d="3140">but they certainly are
going to be around.</p>
<p t="2328430" d="4580">How could I -- if I started
with this matrix |a b; c d|</p>
<p t="2333010" d="2730">then I wouldn't --</p>
<p t="2335740" d="1740">I'm not even going
to write this down,</p>
<p t="2337480" d="5980">I'm just going to ask you,
because in elimination, we're</p>
<p t="2343460" d="1780">doing rows.</p>
<p t="2345240" d="2850">But suppose we
wanted to exchange</p>
<p t="2348090" d="2135">the columns of a matrix.</p>
<p t="2353180" d="2270">How would I do that?</p>
<p t="2355450" d="3660">What matrix multiplication
would do that job?</p>
<p t="2359110" d="870">Actually, why not?</p>
<p t="2359980" d="2040">I'll write it down.</p>
<p t="2362020" d="1820">So this is --</p>
<p t="2363840" d="4380">I'll write it under here
and then hide it again.</p>
<p t="2368220" d="520">Okay.</p>
<p t="2368740" d="3840">Suppose I had my
matrix |a b; c d|</p>
<p t="2372580" d="5580">and I want to get to a c
over here and b d here.</p>
<p t="2384790" d="1830">What matrix does that job?</p>
<p t="2392300" d="6220">Can I multiply -- can I cook up
some matrix that produces that</p>
<p t="2398520" d="2280">answer?</p>
<p t="2400800" d="3400">You can see from where I
put my hand I was really</p>
<p t="2404200" d="5460">asking can I put a matrix
here on the left that</p>
<p t="2409660" d="2190">will exchange columns?</p>
<p t="2411850" d="4410">And the answer is no.</p>
<p t="2416260" d="1740">I'm just bringing
out again this point</p>
<p t="2418000" d="4940">that when I multiply on the
left, I'm doing row operations.</p>
<p t="2422940" d="1850">So if I want to do
a column operation,</p>
<p t="2424790" d="4470">where do I put that
permutation matrix?</p>
<p t="2429260" d="1710">On the right.</p>
<p t="2430970" d="4250">If I put it here, where I just
barely left room for it --</p>
<p t="2435220" d="5010">so I'll exchange the two
columns of the identity.</p>
<p t="2440230" d="3180">Then it comes out
right, because now I'm</p>
<p t="2443410" d="2570">multiplying a column at a time.</p>
<p t="2445980" d="3250">This is the first column
and says take one --</p>
<p t="2449230" d="3270">take none of that column,
one of this one and then you</p>
<p t="2452500" d="1000">got it.</p>
<p t="2453500" d="2740">Over here, take one
of this one, none</p>
<p t="2456240" d="2180">of this one and you've got a c.</p>
<p t="2458420" d="3570">So, in short, to do
column operations,</p>
<p t="2461990" d="2320">the matrix multiplies
on the right.</p>
<p t="2464310" d="3350">To do row operations, it
multiplies on the left.</p>
<p t="2467660" d="4330">Okay, okay, and it's row
operations that we're really</p>
<p t="2471990" d="545">doing.</p>
<p t="2472535" d="500">Okay.</p>
<p t="2478790" d="4440">And of course, I
mentioned in passing,</p>
<p t="2483230" d="7610">but I better say it very
clearly that you can't exchange</p>
<p t="2490840" d="1280">the orders of matrices.</p>
<p t="2492120" d="3220">And that's just the point
I was making again here.</p>
<p t="2495340" d="4180">A times B is not the
same as B times A.</p>
<p t="2499520" d="6510">You have to keep these matrices
in their Gauss given order</p>
<p t="2506030" d="3720">here, right?</p>
<p t="2509750" d="3180">But you can move
the parentheses,</p>
<p t="2512930" d="4380">so that, in other words,
the commutative law, which</p>
<p t="2517310" d="6540">would allow you to take it
in the other order is false.</p>
<p t="2523850" d="2080">So we have to keep
it in that order.</p>
<p t="2525930" d="760">Okay.</p>
<p t="2526690" d="4225">So what next?</p>
<p t="2533730" d="2940">I could do this multiplication.</p>
<p t="2536670" d="2440">I could do E 32.</p>
<p t="2539110" d="2415">So let me come back
to see what that was.</p>
<p t="2544750" d="3720">Here was E 2 1.</p>
<p t="2548470" d="4550">And here is E 3 2.</p>
<p t="2553020" d="6300">And if I multiply those
two matrices together --</p>
<p t="2559320" d="3744">E 3 2 and then E 2 1,
I'll get a single matrix</p>
<p t="2563064" d="916">that does elimination.</p>
<p t="2569240" d="2870">I don't want to do it that --</p>
<p t="2572110" d="3240">if I do that multiplication --</p>
<p t="2575350" d="5440">there -- there's a
better way to do this.</p>
<p t="2580790" d="2730">And so in this last few
minutes of today's lecture,</p>
<p t="2583520" d="2020">can I anticipate
that better way?</p>
<p t="2588320" d="6940">The better way is to think
not how do I get from A to U,</p>
<p t="2595260" d="5050">but how do I get
from U back to A?</p>
<p t="2600310" d="4420">So reversing steps
is going to come in.</p>
<p t="2604730" d="4220">Inverse -- I'll use
the word inverse here.</p>
<p t="2608950" d="680">Okay.</p>
<p t="2609630" d="7620">So let me make the first step
at what's the inverse matrix?</p>
<p t="2617250" d="3310">All the matrices you've seen
on this board have inverses.</p>
<p t="2623720" d="4190">I didn't write any
bad matrices down.</p>
<p t="2627910" d="2860">We spoke about possible
failure, and for a moment,</p>
<p t="2630770" d="2630">we put in a matrix
that would fail.</p>
<p t="2633400" d="2860">But right now, all
these matrices are good,</p>
<p t="2636260" d="1460">they're all invertible.</p>
<p t="2637720" d="3290">And let's take the
inverse -- well,</p>
<p t="2641010" d="3790">let me say first what does
the inverse mean and find it?</p>
<p t="2644800" d="500">Okay.</p>
<p t="2645300" d="5550">So we're getting a little
leg up on inverses.</p>
<p t="2650850" d="5322">Okay, so this is the
final moments of today.</p>
<p t="2658770" d="4100">Sorry, he's still there.</p>
<p t="2662870" d="512">Okay.</p>
<p t="2663382" d="500">Inverses.</p>
<p t="2671290" d="2030">Okay, and I'm just going
to take one example</p>
<p t="2673320" d="1550">and then we're done.</p>
<p t="2674870" d="4610">The example I'll take will
be that E. So my matrix</p>
<p t="2679480" d="6160">is 1 0 0 minus 3 1 0 0 0 1.</p>
<p t="2688240" d="7630">And I want to find the
matrix that undoes that step.</p>
<p t="2695870" d="1850">So what was that step?</p>
<p t="2697720" d="5880">The step was subtract 3
times row one from row two.</p>
<p t="2703600" d="7070">So what matrix will get me back?</p>
<p t="2710670" d="3870">What matrix will bring back --</p>
<p t="2714540" d="4990">you know, if I started with a 2
12 2 and I changed it to a 2 6</p>
<p t="2719530" d="6050">2 because of this guy, I want
to get back to the 2 12 I want</p>
<p t="2725580" d="4570">to find the matrix which --
which undoes elimination,</p>
<p t="2730150" d="3090">the matrix which multiplies
this to give the identity.</p>
<p t="2738390" d="4550">And you can tell me what I
should do in words first,</p>
<p t="2742940" d="2630">and then we'll write down
the matrix that does it.</p>
<p t="2745570" d="4560">If this step subtracted
3 times row 1 from row 2,</p>
<p t="2750130" d="1370">what's the inverse step?</p>
<p t="2751500" d="10620">I add 3 times row one
to row two, right?</p>
<p t="2762120" d="960">I add it back.</p>
<p t="2763080" d="2530">The -- what I subtracted
away, I add back.</p>
<p t="2765610" d="3160">So the inverse matrix
in this case is --</p>
<p t="2768770" d="3890">I now want to add 3
times row one to row two,</p>
<p t="2772660" d="4360">so I won't change row one,
I won't change row three</p>
<p t="2777020" d="5980">and I'll add 3 times
row one to row two.</p>
<p t="2783000" d="4740">That's a case where
the inverse is clear.</p>
<p t="2787740" d="5790">It's clear in words what to
do, because what this did</p>
<p t="2793530" d="3800">was simple to express.</p>
<p t="2797330" d="5960">It just changed row two by
subtracting 3 of row one.</p>
<p t="2803290" d="2380">So to invert it, I go that way.</p>
<p t="2805670" d="2270">And if you -- if we
do that calculation,</p>
<p t="2807940" d="3300">3 times this row plus
1 times this row,</p>
<p t="2811240" d="2740">comes out the right
row of the identity.</p>
<p t="2813980" d="3070">Okay, so inverses are an --</p>
<p t="2817050" d="7970">so if this matrix was E and this
matrix is I for identity, then</p>
<p t="2825020" d="3350">what's the notation
for this guy?</p>
<p t="2828370" d="2640">E to the minus one.</p>
<p t="2831010" d="1700">E inverse.</p>
<p t="2832710" d="1240">Okay.</p>
<p t="2833950" d="2090">Let's stop there for today.</p>
<p t="2836040" d="4620">That's a little jump on
what's coming on Monday.</p>
<p t="2840660" d="2390">So, see you Monday.</p>
