<p t="21250" d="2930">Professor: So, again
welcome to 18.01.</p>
<p t="24180" d="3020">We're getting started
today with what</p>
<p t="27200" d="8800">we're calling Unit One, a
highly imaginative title.</p>
<p t="36000" d="7050">And it's differentiation.</p>
<p t="43050" d="2910">So, let me first
tell you, briefly,</p>
<p t="45960" d="3360">what's in store in the
next couple of weeks.</p>
<p t="49320" d="12850">The main topic today is
what is a derivative.</p>
<p t="62170" d="7670">And, we're going to look at this
from several different points</p>
<p t="69840" d="8980">of view, and the first one is
the geometric interpretation.</p>
<p t="78820" d="2890">That's what we'll
spend most of today on.</p>
<p t="81710" d="10620">And then, we'll also talk
about a physical interpretation</p>
<p t="92330" d="4910">of what a derivative is.</p>
<p t="97240" d="7670">And then there's going to
be something else which</p>
<p t="104910" d="3120">I guess is maybe the reason
why Calculus is so fundamental,</p>
<p t="108030" d="5210">and why we always start with it
in most science and engineering</p>
<p t="113240" d="8180">schools, which is the importance
of derivatives, of this,</p>
<p t="121420" d="7870">to all measurements.</p>
<p t="129290" d="2100">So that means pretty
much every place.</p>
<p t="131390" d="3750">That means in science,
in engineering,</p>
<p t="135140" d="8640">in economics, in
political science, etc.</p>
<p t="143780" d="3950">Polling, lots of
commercial applications,</p>
<p t="147730" d="1880">just about everything.</p>
<p t="149610" d="3430">Now, that's what we'll
be getting started with,</p>
<p t="153040" d="2440">and then there's
another thing that we're</p>
<p t="155480" d="6020">gonna do in this unit, which
is we're going to explain</p>
<p t="161500" d="8240">how to differentiate anything.</p>
<p t="169740" d="11750">So, how to differentiate
any function you know.</p>
<p t="181490" d="2770">And that's kind of a
tall order, but let</p>
<p t="184260" d="1396">me just give you an example.</p>
<p t="185656" d="1416">If you want to
take the derivative</p>
<p t="187072" d="2568">- this we'll see
today is the notation</p>
<p t="189640" d="4110">for the derivative of something
- of some messy function like e</p>
<p t="193750" d="1670">^ x arctan x.</p>
<p t="199730" d="6000">We'll work this out by
the end of this unit.</p>
<p t="205730" d="660">All right?</p>
<p t="206390" d="2700">Anything you can think of,
anything you can write down,</p>
<p t="209090" d="3050">we can differentiate it.</p>
<p t="212140" d="5680">All right, so that's what we're
gonna do, and today, as I said,</p>
<p t="217820" d="1860">we're gonna spend
most of our time</p>
<p t="219680" d="5010">on this geometric
interpretation.</p>
<p t="224690" d="5390">So let's begin with that.</p>
<p t="230080" d="11490">So here we go with the geometric
interpretation of derivatives.</p>
<p t="241570" d="9590">And, what we're going to do is
just ask the geometric problem</p>
<p t="251160" d="14330">of finding the tangent
line to some graph</p>
<p t="265490" d="6090">of some function at some point.</p>
<p t="271580" d="1670">Which is to say (x_0, y_0).</p>
<p t="273250" d="9210">So that's the problem that
we're addressing here.</p>
<p t="282460" d="4020">Alright, so here's
our problem, and now</p>
<p t="286480" d="2960">let me show you the solution.</p>
<p t="289440" d="9090">So, well, let's
graph the function.</p>
<p t="298530" d="1980">Here's its graph.</p>
<p t="300510" d="2080">Here's some point.</p>
<p t="302590" d="7030">All right, maybe I should
draw it just a bit lower.</p>
<p t="309620" d="4330">So here's a point P.
Maybe it's above the point</p>
<p t="313950" d="5130">x_0. x_0, by the way, this
was supposed to be an x_0.</p>
<p t="319080" d="7790">That was some fixed
place on the x-axis.</p>
<p t="326870" d="5370">And now, in order to
perform this mighty feat,</p>
<p t="332240" d="4460">I will use another
color of chalk.</p>
<p t="336700" d="1010">How about red?</p>
<p t="337710" d="1190">OK.</p>
<p t="338900" d="3180">So here it is.</p>
<p t="342080" d="2360">There's the tangent line,
well, not quite straight.</p>
<p t="344440" d="1420">Close enough.</p>
<p t="345860" d="960">All right?</p>
<p t="346820" d="2220">I did it.</p>
<p t="349040" d="1660">That's the geometric problem.</p>
<p t="350700" d="5790">I achieved what I
wanted to do, and it's</p>
<p t="356490" d="2320">kind of an interesting
question, which unfortunately I</p>
<p t="358810" d="2710">can't solve for you
in this class, which</p>
<p t="361520" d="1720">is, how did I do that?</p>
<p t="363240" d="1630">That is, how
physically did I manage</p>
<p t="364870" d="3020">to know what to do to
draw this tangent line?</p>
<p t="367890" d="2720">But that's what geometric
problems are like.</p>
<p t="370610" d="1390">We visualize it.</p>
<p t="372000" d="2050">We can figure it out
somewhere in our brains.</p>
<p t="374050" d="1370">It happens.</p>
<p t="375420" d="3430">And the task that we
have now is to figure out</p>
<p t="378850" d="4820">how to do it analytically,
to do it in a way</p>
<p t="383670" d="4966">that a machine could
just as well as I did</p>
<p t="388636" d="3594">in drawing this tangent line.</p>
<p t="392230" d="7390">So, what did we learn in high
school about what a tangent</p>
<p t="399620" d="1150">line is?</p>
<p t="400770" d="1970">Well, a tangent line
has an equation,</p>
<p t="402740" d="2960">and any line through a
point has the equation y</p>
<p t="405700" d="6490">- y_0 is equal to m, the
slope, times x - x_0.</p>
<p t="412190" d="6690">So here's the equation
for that line,</p>
<p t="418880" d="3320">and now there are two
pieces of information</p>
<p t="422200" d="5110">that we're going to need to
work out what the line is.</p>
<p t="427310" d="3550">The first one is the point.</p>
<p t="430860" d="2370">That's that point P there.</p>
<p t="433230" d="3440">And to specify P,
given x, we need</p>
<p t="436670" d="6350">to know the level of y, which
is of course just f(x_0).</p>
<p t="443020" d="2060">That's not a calculus
problem, but anyway that's</p>
<p t="445080" d="3270">a very important
part of the process.</p>
<p t="448350" d="3480">So that's the first
thing we need to know.</p>
<p t="451830" d="7660">And the second thing we
need to know is the slope.</p>
<p t="459490" d="2650">And that's this number m.</p>
<p t="462140" d="3200">And in calculus we have
another name for it.</p>
<p t="465340" d="2830">We call it f prime of x_0.</p>
<p t="468170" d="3350">Namely, the derivative of f.</p>
<p t="471520" d="1559">So that's the calculus part.</p>
<p t="473079" d="1791">That's the tricky part,
and that's the part</p>
<p t="474870" d="2890">that we have to discuss now.</p>
<p t="477760" d="3150">So just to make
that explicit here,</p>
<p t="480910" d="5030">I'm going to make a definition,
which is that f '(x_0) ,</p>
<p t="485940" d="13170">which is known as the
derivative, of f, at x_0,</p>
<p t="499110" d="21830">is the slope of the tangent
line to y = f(x) at the point,</p>
<p t="520940" d="6920">let's just call it P.</p>
<p t="527860" d="2140">All right?</p>
<p t="530000" d="5270">So, that's what
it is, but still I</p>
<p t="535270" d="3920">haven't made any progress in
figuring out any better how</p>
<p t="539190" d="1930">I drew that line.</p>
<p t="541120" d="2580">So I have to say
something that's</p>
<p t="543700" d="2510">more concrete, because I
want to be able to cook up</p>
<p t="546210" d="1200">what these numbers are.</p>
<p t="547410" d="4020">I have to figure out
what this number m is.</p>
<p t="551430" d="5440">And one way of thinking about
that, let me just try this,</p>
<p t="556870" d="2224">so I certainly am
taking for granted that</p>
<p t="559094" d="1666">in sort of non-calculus
part that I know</p>
<p t="560760" d="2060">what a line through a point is.</p>
<p t="562820" d="1620">So I know this equation.</p>
<p t="564440" d="7527">But another possibility
might be, this line here,</p>
<p t="571967" d="2083">how do I know - well,
unfortunately, I didn't draw</p>
<p t="574050" d="120">it quite straight,
but there it is -</p>
<p t="574170" d="3600">how do I know that this orange
line is not a tangent line,</p>
<p t="577770" d="7300">but this other line
is a tangent line?</p>
<p t="585070" d="7940">Well, it's actually
not so obvious,</p>
<p t="593010" d="3190">but I'm gonna describe
it a little bit.</p>
<p t="596200" d="2340">It's not really the
fact-- this thing</p>
<p t="598540" d="2510">crosses at some
other place, which</p>
<p t="601050" d="3440">is this point Q. But
it's not really the fact</p>
<p t="604490" d="2020">that the thing
crosses at two place,</p>
<p t="606510" d="1375">because the line
could be wiggly,</p>
<p t="607885" d="2685">the curve could be wiggly,
and it could cross back</p>
<p t="610570" d="1420">and forth a number of times.</p>
<p t="611990" d="5130">That's not what distinguishes
the tangent line.</p>
<p t="617120" d="2710">So I'm gonna have to
somehow grasp this,</p>
<p t="619830" d="3730">and I'll first do
it in language.</p>
<p t="623560" d="3653">And it's the
following idea: it's</p>
<p t="627213" d="3837">that if you take this
orange line, which</p>
<p t="631050" d="6940">is called a secant line,
and you think of the point Q</p>
<p t="637990" d="4520">as getting closer and closer to
P, then the slope of that line</p>
<p t="642510" d="5350">will get closer and closer
to the slope of the red line.</p>
<p t="647860" d="5387">And if we draw it close
enough, then that's</p>
<p t="653247" d="1083">gonna be the correct line.</p>
<p t="654330" d="2700">So that's really what I did,
sort of in my brain when</p>
<p t="657030" d="1370">I drew that first line.</p>
<p t="658400" d="2610">And so that's the way I'm
going to articulate it first.</p>
<p t="661010" d="12880">Now, so the tangent line is
equal to the limit of so called</p>
<p t="673890" d="10150">secant lines PQ,
as Q tends to P.</p>
<p t="684040" d="7510">And here we're thinking of P as
being fixed and Q as variable.</p>
<p t="691550" d="3870">All right?</p>
<p t="695420" d="2900">Again, this is still the
geometric discussion,</p>
<p t="698320" d="3770">but now we're gonna be able
to put symbols and formulas</p>
<p t="702090" d="1480">to this computation.</p>
<p t="703570" d="12660">And we'll be able to work
out formulas in any example.</p>
<p t="716230" d="2470">So let's do that.</p>
<p t="718700" d="6720">So first of all, I'm gonna write
out these points P and Q again.</p>
<p t="725420" d="5559">So maybe we'll put
P here and Q here.</p>
<p t="730979" d="1791">And I'm thinking of
this line through them.</p>
<p t="732770" d="3420">I guess it was orange, so
we'll leave it as orange.</p>
<p t="736190" d="3380">All right.</p>
<p t="739570" d="4440">And now I want to
compute its slope.</p>
<p t="744010" d="3070">So this, gradually, we'll
do this in two steps.</p>
<p t="747080" d="1890">And these steps
will introduce us</p>
<p t="748970" d="2990">to the basic notations which
are used throughout calculus,</p>
<p t="751960" d="3390">including multi-variable
calculus, across the board.</p>
<p t="755350" d="2610">So the first
notation that's used</p>
<p t="757960" d="4480">is you imagine here's
the x-axis underneath,</p>
<p t="762440" d="5050">and here's the x_0, the location
directly below the point P.</p>
<p t="767490" d="4010">And we're traveling here a
horizontal distance which</p>
<p t="771500" d="2150">is denoted by delta x.</p>
<p t="773650" d="5330">So that's delta x, so called.</p>
<p t="778980" d="7980">And we could also call
it the change in x.</p>
<p t="786960" d="2960">So that's one thing we want
to measure in order to get</p>
<p t="789920" d="2370">the slope of this line PQ.</p>
<p t="792290" d="2240">And the other thing
is this height.</p>
<p t="794530" d="3520">So that's this distance here,
which we denote delta f,</p>
<p t="798050" d="3930">which is the change in f.</p>
<p t="801980" d="7330">And then, the slope is just
the ratio, delta f / delta x.</p>
<p t="809310" d="10470">So this is the
slope of the secant.</p>
<p t="819780" d="4500">And the process I just described
over here with this limit</p>
<p t="824280" d="2100">applies not just to
the whole line itself,</p>
<p t="826380" d="2540">but also in particular
to its slope.</p>
<p t="828920" d="5070">And the way we write that is
the limit as delta x goes to 0.</p>
<p t="833990" d="2980">And that's going
to be our slope.</p>
<p t="836970" d="13880">So this is the slope
of the tangent line.</p>
<p t="850850" d="1010">OK.</p>
<p t="851860" d="7600">Now, This is still
a little general,</p>
<p t="859460" d="7000">and I want to work out
a more usable form here,</p>
<p t="866460" d="2040">a better formula for this.</p>
<p t="868500" d="2210">And in order to
do that, I'm gonna</p>
<p t="870710" d="5650">write delta f, the numerator
more explicitly here.</p>
<p t="876360" d="4770">The change in f, so
remember that the point P</p>
<p t="881130" d="2320">is the point (x_0, f(x_0)).</p>
<p t="883450" d="7730">All right, that's what we got
for the formula for the point.</p>
<p t="891180" d="3775">And in order to
compute these distances</p>
<p t="894955" d="2525">and in particular the
vertical distance here,</p>
<p t="897480" d="3340">I'm gonna have to get a
formula for Q as well.</p>
<p t="900820" d="4480">So if this horizontal
distance is delta x,</p>
<p t="905300" d="5720">then this location
is x_0 + delta x.</p>
<p t="911020" d="2790">And so the point
above that point</p>
<p t="913810" d="7060">has a formula, which
is x_0 plus delta</p>
<p t="920870" d="10810">x, f of - and this is a
mouthful - x_0 plus delta x.</p>
<p t="931680" d="2270">All right, so there's the
formula for the point Q.</p>
<p t="933950" d="2466">Here's the formula
for the point P.</p>
<p t="936416" d="11144">And now I can write a different
formula for the derivative,</p>
<p t="947560" d="4640">which is the following:
so this f'(x_0) ,</p>
<p t="952200" d="6180">which is the same as m, is going
to be the limit as delta x goes</p>
<p t="958380" d="7020">to 0 of the change in f, well
the change in f is the value</p>
<p t="965400" d="7180">of f at the upper point
here, which is x_0 + delta x,</p>
<p t="972580" d="7300">and minus its value at the
lower point P, which is f(x_0),</p>
<p t="979880" d="3370">divided by delta x.</p>
<p t="983250" d="1420">All right, so this
is the formula.</p>
<p t="984670" d="3630">I'm going to put
this in a little box,</p>
<p t="988300" d="4530">because this is by far the
most important formula today,</p>
<p t="992830" d="2580">which we use to derive
pretty much everything else.</p>
<p t="995410" d="1750">And this is the way
that we're going to be</p>
<p t="997160" d="9100">able to compute these numbers.</p>
<p t="1006260" d="20020">So let's do an example.</p>
<p t="1026280" d="7080">This example, we'll
call this example one.</p>
<p t="1033360" d="6430">We'll take the function
f(x) , which is 1/x .</p>
<p t="1039790" d="3800">That's sufficiently complicated
to have an interesting answer,</p>
<p t="1043590" d="4070">and sufficiently straightforward
that we can compute</p>
<p t="1047660" d="5010">the derivative fairly quickly.</p>
<p t="1052670" d="3460">So what is it that
we're gonna do here?</p>
<p t="1056130" d="6420">All we're going to do is we're
going to plug in this formula</p>
<p t="1062550" d="2020">here for that function.</p>
<p t="1064570" d="3010">That's all we're going
to do, and visually</p>
<p t="1067580" d="4430">what we're accomplishing is
somehow to take the hyperbola,</p>
<p t="1072010" d="3040">and take a point
on the hyperbola,</p>
<p t="1075050" d="5840">and figure out
some tangent line.</p>
<p t="1080890" d="2242">That's what we're
accomplishing when we do that.</p>
<p t="1083132" d="1708">So we're accomplishing
this geometrically</p>
<p t="1084840" d="2220">but we'll be doing
it algebraically.</p>
<p t="1087060" d="7800">So first, we consider this
difference delta f / delta x</p>
<p t="1094860" d="1710">and write out its formula.</p>
<p t="1096570" d="1620">So I have to have a place.</p>
<p t="1098190" d="3480">So I'm gonna make it again
above this point x_0, which</p>
<p t="1101670" d="880">is the general point.</p>
<p t="1102550" d="3390">We'll make the
general calculation.</p>
<p t="1105940" d="4370">So the value of f at the top,
when we move to the right</p>
<p t="1110310" d="5610">by f(x), so I just read off
from this, read off from here.</p>
<p t="1115920" d="4980">The formula, the first
thing I get here is 1 /</p>
<p t="1120900" d="2630">(x_0 + delta x).</p>
<p t="1123530" d="3030">That's the left hand term.</p>
<p t="1126560" d="3692">Minus 1 / x_0, that's
the right hand term.</p>
<p t="1130252" d="3928">And then I have to
divide that by delta x.</p>
<p t="1134180" d="3740">OK, so here's our expression.</p>
<p t="1137920" d="2540">And by the way this has a name.</p>
<p t="1140460" d="9780">This thing is called
a difference quotient.</p>
<p t="1150240" d="2090">It's pretty complicated,
because there's always</p>
<p t="1152330" d="1249">a difference in the numerator.</p>
<p t="1153579" d="2521">And in disguise, the
denominator is a difference,</p>
<p t="1156100" d="2300">because it's the difference
between the value</p>
<p t="1158400" d="7910">on the right side and the
value on the left side here.</p>
<p t="1166310" d="8430">OK, so now we're going to
simplify it by some algebra.</p>
<p t="1174740" d="1120">So let's just take a look.</p>
<p t="1175860" d="4400">So this is equal to, let's
continue on the next level</p>
<p t="1180260" d="910">here.</p>
<p t="1181170" d="3930">This is equal to 1
/ delta x times...</p>
<p t="1185100" d="4120">All I'm going to do is put
it over a common denominator.</p>
<p t="1189220" d="7200">So the common denominator
is (x_0 + delta x) * x_0.</p>
<p t="1196420" d="4300">And so in the numerator for the
first expressions I have x_0,</p>
<p t="1200720" d="4570">and for the second expression
I have x_0 + delta x.</p>
<p t="1205290" d="3500">So this is the same thing as
I had in the numerator before,</p>
<p t="1208790" d="2660">factoring out this denominator.</p>
<p t="1211450" d="5590">And here I put that numerator
into this more amenable form.</p>
<p t="1217040" d="3320">And now there are two
basic cancellations.</p>
<p t="1220360" d="12800">The first one is that x_0 and
x_0 cancel, so we have this.</p>
<p t="1233160" d="5734">And then the second step is that
these two expressions cancel,</p>
<p t="1238894" d="1416">the numerator and
the denominator.</p>
<p t="1240310" d="3780">Now we have a cancellation
that we can make use of.</p>
<p t="1244090" d="4590">So we'll write that under here.</p>
<p t="1248680" d="9010">And this is equals -1 over
x_0 plus delta x times x_0.</p>
<p t="1257690" d="5790">And then the very last step
is to take the limit as delta</p>
<p t="1263480" d="6070">x tends to 0, and
now we can do it.</p>
<p t="1269550" d="1140">Before we couldn't do it.</p>
<p t="1270690" d="870">Why?</p>
<p t="1271560" d="3660">Because the numerator and the
denominator gave us 0 / 0.</p>
<p t="1275220" d="2590">But now that I've made
this cancellation,</p>
<p t="1277810" d="1620">I can pass to the limit.</p>
<p t="1279430" d="2670">And all that happens is
I set this delta x to 0,</p>
<p t="1282100" d="810">and I get -1/x_0^2.</p>
<p t="1285950" d="5778">So that's the answer.</p>
<p t="1291728" d="1916">All right, so in other
words what I've shown -</p>
<p t="1293644" d="2366">let me put it up here - is
that f'(x_0) = -1/x_0^2.</p>
<p t="1312700" d="3210">Now, let's look at the
graph just a little</p>
<p t="1315910" d="5700">bit to check this for
plausibility, all right?</p>
<p t="1321610" d="3330">What's happening here is,
first of all it's negative.</p>
<p t="1324940" d="3380">It's less than 0,
which is a good thing.</p>
<p t="1328320" d="8190">You see that slope
there is negative.</p>
<p t="1336510" d="4350">That's the simplest check
that you could make.</p>
<p t="1340860" d="3670">And the second thing that I
would just like to point out</p>
<p t="1344530" d="4850">is that as x goes to infinity,
that as we go farther</p>
<p t="1349380" d="3330">to the right, it gets
less and less steep.</p>
<p t="1352710" d="13340">So as x_0 goes to infinity,
less and less steep.</p>
<p t="1366050" d="2610">So that's also
consistent here, when</p>
<p t="1368660" d="2800">x_0 is very large, this is
a smaller and smaller number</p>
<p t="1371460" d="2810">in magnitude, although
it's always negative.</p>
<p t="1374270" d="6480">It's always sloping down.</p>
<p t="1380750" d="3110">All right, so I've managed
to fill the boards.</p>
<p t="1383860" d="2150">So maybe I should stop
for a question or two.</p>
<p t="1386010" d="500">Yes?</p>
<p t="1386510" d="4920">Student: [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p t="1391430" d="7210">Professor: So the question
is to explain again</p>
<p t="1398640" d="3680">this limiting process.</p>
<p t="1402320" d="4390">So the formula here is we
have basically two numbers.</p>
<p t="1406710" d="2320">So in other words, why is
it that this expression,</p>
<p t="1409030" d="4890">when delta x tends to 0,
is equal to -1 / x_0^2 ?</p>
<p t="1413920" d="3970">Let me illustrate it by
sticking in a number for x_0</p>
<p t="1417890" d="1850">to make it more explicit.</p>
<p t="1419740" d="3030">All right, so for
instance, let me stick</p>
<p t="1422770" d="3340">in here for x_0 the number 3.</p>
<p t="1426110" d="6340">Then it's -1 over 3
plus delta x times 3.</p>
<p t="1432450" d="1970">That's the situation
that we've got.</p>
<p t="1434420" d="1610">And now the question
is what happens</p>
<p t="1436030" d="2650">as this number gets smaller
and smaller and smaller,</p>
<p t="1438680" d="3010">and gets to be practically 0?</p>
<p t="1441690" d="2845">Well, literally what we can
do is just plug in 0 there,</p>
<p t="1444535" d="2875">and you get 3 plus 0 times
3 in the denominator.</p>
<p t="1447410" d="1430">-1 in the numerator.</p>
<p t="1448840" d="7190">So this tends to
-1/9 (over 3^2).</p>
<p t="1456030" d="4841">And that's what I'm saying in
general with this extra number</p>
<p t="1460871" d="499">here.</p>
<p t="1461370" d="3990">Other questions?</p>
<p t="1465360" d="500">Yes.</p>
<p t="1465860" d="8820">Student: [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p t="1474680" d="4680">Professor: So the
question is what</p>
<p t="1479360" d="4290">happened between this
step and this step, right?</p>
<p t="1483650" d="2100">Explain this step here.</p>
<p t="1485750" d="2400">Alright, so there were
two parts to that.</p>
<p t="1488150" d="5290">The first is this delta x which
is sitting in the denominator,</p>
<p t="1493440" d="2570">I factored all
the way out front.</p>
<p t="1496010" d="1960">And so what's in
the parentheses is</p>
<p t="1497970" d="2630">supposed to be
the same as what's</p>
<p t="1500600" d="2520">in the numerator of
this other expression.</p>
<p t="1503120" d="2450">And then, at the
same time as doing</p>
<p t="1505570" d="2510">that, I put that
expression, which</p>
<p t="1508080" d="2252">is the difference
of two fractions,</p>
<p t="1510332" d="1708">I expressed it with
a common denominator.</p>
<p t="1512040" d="1458">So in the denominator
here, you see</p>
<p t="1513498" d="3542">the product of the denominators
of the two fractions.</p>
<p t="1517040" d="3190">And then I just figured out what
the numerator had to be without</p>
<p t="1520230" d="2560">really...</p>
<p t="1522790" d="4870">Other questions?</p>
<p t="1527660" d="5180">OK.</p>
<p t="1532840" d="6830">So I claim that on
the whole, calculus</p>
<p t="1539670" d="3430">gets a bad rap,
that it's actually</p>
<p t="1543100" d="4120">easier than most things.</p>
<p t="1547220" d="4820">But there's a perception
that it's harder.</p>
<p t="1552040" d="4800">And so I really have a duty
to give you the calculus made</p>
<p t="1556840" d="2370">harder story here.</p>
<p t="1559210" d="4420">So we have to make things
harder, because that's our job.</p>
<p t="1563630" d="2650">And this is actually what
most people do in calculus,</p>
<p t="1566280" d="3280">and it's the reason why
calculus has a bad reputation.</p>
<p t="1569560" d="5460">So the secret is
that when people</p>
<p t="1575020" d="4340">ask problems in calculus, they
generally ask them in context.</p>
<p t="1579360" d="3340">And there are many, many
other things going on.</p>
<p t="1582700" d="2720">And so the little piece of
the problem which is calculus</p>
<p t="1585420" d="3070">is actually fairly routine and
has to be isolated and gotten</p>
<p t="1588490" d="500">through.</p>
<p t="1588990" d="2140">But all the rest of it,
relies on everything else</p>
<p t="1591130" d="4857">you learned in mathematics up
to this stage, from grade school</p>
<p t="1595987" d="833">through high school.</p>
<p t="1596820" d="3069">So that's the complication.</p>
<p t="1599889" d="2041">So now we're going to do
a little bit of calculus</p>
<p t="1601930" d="7150">made hard.</p>
<p t="1609080" d="4860">By talking about a word problem.</p>
<p t="1613940" d="3950">We only have one sort of word
problem that we can pose,</p>
<p t="1617890" d="5200">because all we've talked about
is this geometry point of view.</p>
<p t="1623090" d="2990">So far those are the only kinds
of word problems we can pose.</p>
<p t="1626080" d="2790">So what we're gonna do is
just pose such a problem.</p>
<p t="1628870" d="14790">So find the areas of
triangles, enclosed</p>
<p t="1643660" d="16110">by the axes and the
tangent to y = 1/x.</p>
<p t="1659770" d="3800">OK, so that's a
geometry problem.</p>
<p t="1663570" d="3030">And let me draw a picture of it.</p>
<p t="1666600" d="5990">It's practically the same as
the picture for example one.</p>
<p t="1672590" d="2320">We only consider
the first quadrant.</p>
<p t="1674910" d="910">Here's our shape.</p>
<p t="1675820" d="4200">All right, it's the hyperbola.</p>
<p t="1680020" d="2620">And here's maybe one
of our tangent lines,</p>
<p t="1682640" d="2450">which is coming in like this.</p>
<p t="1685090" d="7380">And then we're trying
to find this area here.</p>
<p t="1692470" d="1830">Right, so there's our problem.</p>
<p t="1694300" d="1770">So why does it have
to do with calculus?</p>
<p t="1696070" d="1749">It has to do with
calculus because there's</p>
<p t="1697819" d="1971">a tangent line in
it, so we're gonna</p>
<p t="1699790" d="4410">need to do some calculus
to answer this question.</p>
<p t="1704200" d="6300">But as you'll see, the
calculus is the easy part.</p>
<p t="1710500" d="3560">So let's get started
with this problem.</p>
<p t="1714060" d="3090">First of all, I'm gonna
label a few things.</p>
<p t="1717150" d="2620">And one important thing
to remember of course,</p>
<p t="1719770" d="3000">is that the curve is y = 1/x.</p>
<p t="1722770" d="2060">That's perfectly
reasonable to do.</p>
<p t="1724830" d="4020">And also, we're gonna calculate
the areas of the triangles,</p>
<p t="1728850" d="2680">and you could ask
yourself, in terms of what?</p>
<p t="1731530" d="2766">Well, we're gonna have to pick
a point and give it a name.</p>
<p t="1734296" d="1374">And since we need
a number, we're</p>
<p t="1735670" d="1499">gonna have to do
more than geometry.</p>
<p t="1737169" d="2121">We're gonna have to do
some of this analysis</p>
<p t="1739290" d="1720">just as we've done before.</p>
<p t="1741010" d="3120">So I'm gonna pick a point and,
consistent with the labeling</p>
<p t="1744130" d="4190">we've done before, I'm
gonna to call it (x_0, y_0).</p>
<p t="1748320" d="5050">So that's almost half the
battle, having notations, x</p>
<p t="1753370" d="2850">and y for the variables,
and x_0 and y_0,</p>
<p t="1756220" d="2740">for the specific point.</p>
<p t="1758960" d="5350">Now, once you see that
you have these labelings,</p>
<p t="1764310" d="3760">I hope it's reasonable
to do the following.</p>
<p t="1768070" d="3310">So first of all, this
is the point x_0,</p>
<p t="1771380" d="2250">and over here is the point y_0.</p>
<p t="1773630" d="4100">That's something that
we're used to in graphs.</p>
<p t="1777730" d="2470">And in order to figure out
the area of this triangle,</p>
<p t="1780200" d="1750">it's pretty clear
that we should find</p>
<p t="1781950" d="3790">the base, which is that we
should find this location here.</p>
<p t="1785740" d="2210">And we should find
the height, so we</p>
<p t="1787950" d="7640">need to find that value there.</p>
<p t="1795590" d="3220">Let's go ahead and do it.</p>
<p t="1798810" d="3580">So how are we going to do this?</p>
<p t="1802390" d="12570">Well, so let's just take a look.</p>
<p t="1814960" d="2190">So what is it that
we need to do?</p>
<p t="1817150" d="3923">I claim that there's
only one calculus step,</p>
<p t="1821073" d="4557">and I'm gonna put a star
here for this tangent line.</p>
<p t="1825630" d="2842">I have to understand
what the tangent line is.</p>
<p t="1828472" d="1958">Once I've figured out
what the tangent line is,</p>
<p t="1830430" d="2800">the rest of the problem
is no longer calculus.</p>
<p t="1833230" d="2660">It's just that
slope that we need.</p>
<p t="1835890" d="2520">So what's the formula
for the tangent line?</p>
<p t="1838410" d="7420">Put that over here. it's going
to be y - y_0 is equal to,</p>
<p t="1845830" d="2350">and here's the magic number,
we already calculated it.</p>
<p t="1848180" d="2790">It's in the box over there.</p>
<p t="1850970" d="7300">It's -1/x_0^2 ( x - x_0).</p>
<p t="1858270" d="14400">So this is the only bit of
calculus in this problem.</p>
<p t="1872670" d="2830">But now we're not done.</p>
<p t="1875500" d="1250">We have to finish it.</p>
<p t="1876750" d="2420">We have to figure out all
the rest of these quantities</p>
<p t="1879170" d="8130">so we can figure out the area.</p>
<p t="1887300" d="3860">All right.</p>
<p t="1891160" d="9760">So how do we do that?</p>
<p t="1900920" d="3760">Well, to find this
point, this has a name.</p>
<p t="1904680" d="8050">We're gonna find the
so called x-intercept.</p>
<p t="1912730" d="1900">That's the first thing
we're going to do.</p>
<p t="1914630" d="3170">So to do that,
what we need to do</p>
<p t="1917800" d="4650">is to find where this horizontal
line meets that diagonal line.</p>
<p t="1922450" d="8460">And the equation for the
x-intercept is y = 0.</p>
<p t="1930910" d="2405">So we plug in y = 0, that's
this horizontal line,</p>
<p t="1933315" d="1925">and we find this point.</p>
<p t="1935240" d="3200">So let's do that into star.</p>
<p t="1938440" d="4390">We get 0 minus, oh one
other thing we need to know.</p>
<p t="1942830" d="5940">We know that y0 is f(x_0)
, and f(x) is 1/x ,</p>
<p t="1948770" d="2290">so this thing is 1/x_0.</p>
<p t="1953780" d="4820">And that's equal to -1/x_0^2.</p>
<p t="1958600" d="3320">And here's x, and here's x_0.</p>
<p t="1961920" d="4580">All right, so in order
to find this x value,</p>
<p t="1966500" d="7300">I have to plug in one
equation into the other.</p>
<p t="1973800" d="5370">So this simplifies a bit.</p>
<p t="1979170" d="4080">This is -x/x_0^2.</p>
<p t="1983250" d="6170">And this is plus 1/x_0 because
the x_0 and x0^2 cancel</p>
<p t="1989420" d="1060">somewhat.</p>
<p t="1990480" d="2350">And so if I put this
on the other side,</p>
<p t="1992830" d="7980">I get x / x_0^2 is
equal to 2 / x_0.</p>
<p t="2000810" d="7068">And if I then multiply through
- so that's what this implies -</p>
<p t="2007878" d="12052">and if I multiply through
by x_0^2 I get x = 2x_0.</p>
<p t="2019930" d="2340">OK, so I claim that this
point we've just calculated,</p>
<p t="2022270" d="9570">it's 2x_0.</p>
<p t="2031840" d="5480">Now, I'm almost done.</p>
<p t="2037320" d="2890">I need to get the other one.</p>
<p t="2040210" d="3070">I need to get this one up here.</p>
<p t="2043280" d="3320">Now I'm gonna use a very
big shortcut to do that.</p>
<p t="2046600" d="20890">So the shortcut to the
y-intercept is to use symmetry.</p>
<p t="2067490" d="3410">All right, I claim I can stare
at this and I can look at that,</p>
<p t="2070900" d="2640">and I know the formula
for the y-intercept.</p>
<p t="2073540" d="6351">It's equal to 2y_0.</p>
<p t="2079891" d="499">All right.</p>
<p t="2080390" d="1730">That's what that one is.</p>
<p t="2082120" d="2200">So this one is 2y_0.</p>
<p t="2084320" d="3740">And the reason I know this
is the following: so here's</p>
<p t="2088060" d="4630">the symmetry of the situation,
which is not completely direct.</p>
<p t="2092690" d="3660">It's a kind of mirror
symmetry around the diagonal.</p>
<p t="2096350" d="9030">It involves the exchange
of (x, y) with (y, x);</p>
<p t="2105380" d="1470">so trading the roles of x and y.</p>
<p t="2106850" d="1870">So the symmetry
that I'm using is</p>
<p t="2108720" d="3260">that any formula I get that
involves x's and y's, if I</p>
<p t="2111980" d="2540">trade all the x's and
replace them by y's and trade</p>
<p t="2114520" d="2125">all the y's and replace
them by x's, then</p>
<p t="2116645" d="2075">I'll have a correct
formula on the other way.</p>
<p t="2118720" d="2190">So if everywhere I see
a y I make it an x,</p>
<p t="2120910" d="1966">and everywhere I see
an x I make it a y,</p>
<p t="2122876" d="1124">the switch will take place.</p>
<p t="2124000" d="3230">So why is that?</p>
<p t="2127230" d="3220">That's just an accident
of this equation.</p>
<p t="2130450" d="15620">That's because, so the
symmetry explained...</p>
<p t="2146070" d="2090">is that the equation is y = 1/x.</p>
<p t="2148160" d="4530">But that's the same
thing as xy = 1,</p>
<p t="2152690" d="2020">if I multiply
through by x, which</p>
<p t="2154710" d="4030">is the same thing as x = 1/y.</p>
<p t="2158740" d="6710">So here's where the x
and the y get reversed.</p>
<p t="2165450" d="3020">OK now if you don't
trust this explanation,</p>
<p t="2168470" d="14720">you can also get the
y-intercept by plugging x = 0</p>
<p t="2183190" d="5530">into the equation star.</p>
<p t="2188720" d="580">OK?</p>
<p t="2189300" d="4760">We plugged y = 0 in
and we got the x-value.</p>
<p t="2194060" d="9020">And you can do the same thing
analogously the other way.</p>
<p t="2203080" d="4080">All right so I'm almost done
with the geometry problem,</p>
<p t="2207160" d="11120">and let's finish it off now.</p>
<p t="2218280" d="2650">Well, let me hold off for one
second before I finish it off.</p>
<p t="2220930" d="4100">What I'd like to say is just
make one more tiny remark.</p>
<p t="2225030" d="4170">And this is the hardest part
of calculus in my opinion.</p>
<p t="2229200" d="2690">So the hardest
part of calculus is</p>
<p t="2231890" d="5670">that we call it one
variable calculus,</p>
<p t="2237560" d="2520">but we're perfectly
happy to deal</p>
<p t="2240080" d="5420">with four variables at a
time or five, or any number.</p>
<p t="2245500" d="4300">In this problem, I had an
x, a y, an x_0 and a y_0.</p>
<p t="2249800" d="2280">That's already four
different things</p>
<p t="2252080" d="3384">that have various
relationships between them.</p>
<p t="2255464" d="2416">Of course the manipulations
we do with them are algebraic,</p>
<p t="2257880" d="1940">and when we're doing
the derivatives</p>
<p t="2259820" d="3396">we just consider what's known
as one variable calculus.</p>
<p t="2263216" d="2374">But really there are millions
of variable floating around</p>
<p t="2265590" d="1340">potentially.</p>
<p t="2266930" d="2350">So that's what makes
things complicated,</p>
<p t="2269280" d="2100">and that's something that
you have to get used to.</p>
<p t="2271380" d="2200">Now there's something
else which is more subtle,</p>
<p t="2273580" d="3780">and that I think many
people who teach the subject</p>
<p t="2277360" d="3020">or use the subject aren't
aware, because they've already</p>
<p t="2280380" d="3580">entered into the language and
they're so comfortable with it</p>
<p t="2283960" d="2860">that they don't even
notice this confusion.</p>
<p t="2286820" d="3360">There's something deliberately
sloppy about the way</p>
<p t="2290180" d="2520">we deal with these variables.</p>
<p t="2292700" d="2070">The reason is very simple.</p>
<p t="2294770" d="1980">There are already
four variables here.</p>
<p t="2296750" d="3930">I don't wanna create six names
for variables or eight names</p>
<p t="2300680" d="2940">for variables.</p>
<p t="2303620" d="3090">But really in this problem
there were about eight.</p>
<p t="2306710" d="2570">I just slipped them by you.</p>
<p t="2309280" d="1470">So why is that?</p>
<p t="2310750" d="5160">Well notice that the first time
that I got a formula for y_0</p>
<p t="2315910" d="3670">here, it was this point.</p>
<p t="2319580" d="5100">And so the formula for y_0,
which I plugged in right here,</p>
<p t="2324680" d="5600">was from the equation of
the curve. y_0 = 1 / x_0.</p>
<p t="2330280" d="5040">The second time I did it,
I did not use y = 1/x.</p>
<p t="2335320" d="6320">I used this equation here,
so this is not y = 1/x.</p>
<p t="2341640" d="1840">That's the wrong thing to do.</p>
<p t="2343480" d="2480">It's an easy mistake to
make if the formulas are</p>
<p t="2345960" d="2850">all a blur to you and
you're not paying attention</p>
<p t="2348810" d="2330">to where they are
on the diagram.</p>
<p t="2351140" d="5600">You see that x-intercept
calculation there involved</p>
<p t="2356740" d="4680">where this horizontal line met
this diagonal line, and y = 0</p>
<p t="2361420" d="4470">represented this line here.</p>
<p t="2365890" d="5630">So the sloppiness is that y
means two different things.</p>
<p t="2371520" d="2930">And we do this constantly
because it's way, way more</p>
<p t="2374450" d="3190">complicated not to do it.</p>
<p t="2377640" d="2420">It's much more convenient
for us to allow ourselves</p>
<p t="2380060" d="2600">the flexibility
to change the role</p>
<p t="2382660" d="5070">that this letter plays in
the middle of a computation.</p>
<p t="2387730" d="2380">And similarly, later
on, if I had done this</p>
<p t="2390110" d="4000">by this more straightforward
method, for the y-intercept,</p>
<p t="2394110" d="1250">I would have set x equal to 0.</p>
<p t="2395360" d="4630">That would have been this
vertical line, which is x = 0.</p>
<p t="2399990" d="3530">But I didn't change the letter
x when I did that, because that</p>
<p t="2403520" d="2660">would be a waste for us.</p>
<p t="2406180" d="3160">So this is one of the main
confusions that happens.</p>
<p t="2409340" d="3120">If you can keep
yourself straight,</p>
<p t="2412460" d="2850">you're a lot better
off, and as I</p>
<p t="2415310" d="6410">say this is one of
the complexities.</p>
<p t="2421720" d="3190">All right, so now let's
finish off the problem.</p>
<p t="2424910" d="5970">Let me finally get
this area here.</p>
<p t="2430880" d="2850">So, actually I'll just
finish it off right here.</p>
<p t="2433730" d="7510">So the area of the
triangle is, well</p>
<p t="2441240" d="1640">it's the base times the height.</p>
<p t="2442880" d="3670">The base is 2x_0, the height
is 2y_0, and a half of that.</p>
<p t="2446550" d="8170">So it's 1/2 (2x_0) * (2y_0) ,
which is 2x_0 y_0, which is,</p>
<p t="2454720" d="3060">lo and behold, 2.</p>
<p t="2457780" d="1590">So the amusing
thing in this case</p>
<p t="2459370" d="2640">is that it actually didn't
matter what x_0 and y_0 are.</p>
<p t="2462010" d="3860">We get the same
answer every time.</p>
<p t="2465870" d="4350">That's just an accident
of the function 1 / x.</p>
<p t="2470220" d="9520">It happens to be the
function with that property.</p>
<p t="2479740" d="4050">All right, so we have
some more business today,</p>
<p t="2483790" d="1170">some serious business.</p>
<p t="2484960" d="6020">So let me continue.</p>
<p t="2490980" d="10290">So, first of all, I want to
give you a few more notations.</p>
<p t="2501270" d="8150">And these are just
other notations</p>
<p t="2509420" d="2370">that people use to
refer to derivatives.</p>
<p t="2511790" d="2130">And the first one
is the following:</p>
<p t="2513920" d="2930">we already wrote y = f(x).</p>
<p t="2516850" d="2780">And so when we write
delta y, that means</p>
<p t="2519630" d="2330">the same thing as delta f.</p>
<p t="2521960" d="2390">That's a typical notation.</p>
<p t="2524350" d="9320">And previously we wrote f
prime for the derivative,</p>
<p t="2533670" d="6860">so this is Newton's
notation for the derivative.</p>
<p t="2540530" d="1990">But there are other notations.</p>
<p t="2542520" d="5310">And one of them is df/dx,
and another one is dy/dx,</p>
<p t="2547830" d="2010">meaning exactly the same thing.</p>
<p t="2549840" d="3030">And sometimes we
let the function</p>
<p t="2552870" d="7650">slip down below so that becomes
d/dx of f and d/dx of y.</p>
<p t="2560520" d="3820">So these are all notations that
are used for the derivative,</p>
<p t="2564340" d="4810">and these were
initiated by Leibniz.</p>
<p t="2569150" d="5970">And these notations are used
interchangeably, sometimes</p>
<p t="2575120" d="1620">practically together.</p>
<p t="2576740" d="3010">They both turn out to
be extremely useful.</p>
<p t="2579750" d="3564">This one omits - notice
that this thing omits</p>
<p t="2583314" d="3826">- the underlying
base point, x_0.</p>
<p t="2587140" d="1960">That's one of the nuisances.</p>
<p t="2589100" d="2340">It doesn't give you
all the information.</p>
<p t="2591440" d="6630">But there are lots of situations
like that where people leave</p>
<p t="2598070" d="2020">out some of the
important information,</p>
<p t="2600090" d="3060">and you have to fill
it in from context.</p>
<p t="2603150" d="5210">So that's another
couple of notations.</p>
<p t="2608360" d="4970">So now I have one more
calculation for you today.</p>
<p t="2613330" d="2200">I carried out this
calculation of the derivative</p>
<p t="2615530" d="10250">of the function 1 / x.</p>
<p t="2625780" d="2860">I wanna take care of
some other powers.</p>
<p t="2628640" d="10510">So let's do that.</p>
<p t="2639150" d="9580">So Example 2 is going to
be the function f(x) = x^n.</p>
<p t="2648730" d="5430">n = 1, 2, 3; one of these guys.</p>
<p t="2654160" d="4110">And now what we're trying to
figure out is the derivative</p>
<p t="2658270" d="3200">with respect to x of
x^n in our new notation,</p>
<p t="2661470" d="5600">what this is equal to.</p>
<p t="2667070" d="6380">So again, we're going to form
this expression, delta f /</p>
<p t="2673450" d="1920">delta x.</p>
<p t="2675370" d="3460">And we're going to make some
algebraic simplification.</p>
<p t="2678830" d="6120">So what we plug in for
delta f is ((x delta x)^n -</p>
<p t="2684950" d="3290">x^n)/delta x.</p>
<p t="2688240" d="2220">Now before, let
me just stick this</p>
<p t="2690460" d="1890">in then I'm gonna erase it.</p>
<p t="2692350" d="4140">Before, I wrote x_0
here and x_0 there.</p>
<p t="2696490" d="2900">But now I'm going
to get rid of it,</p>
<p t="2699390" d="2590">because in this particular
calculation, it's a nuisance.</p>
<p t="2701980" d="1560">I don't have an x
floating around,</p>
<p t="2703540" d="2770">which means something
different from the x_0.</p>
<p t="2706310" d="1800">And I just don't
wanna have to keep</p>
<p t="2708110" d="2140">on writing all those symbols.</p>
<p t="2710250" d="3600">It's a waste of
blackboard energy.</p>
<p t="2713850" d="1650">There's a total
amount of energy,</p>
<p t="2715500" d="2764">and I've already filled
up so many blackboards</p>
<p t="2718264" d="3446">that, there's just
a limited amount.</p>
<p t="2721710" d="1940">Plus, I'm trying
to conserve chalk.</p>
<p t="2723650" d="2230">Anyway, no 0's.</p>
<p t="2725880" d="2960">So think of x as fixed.</p>
<p t="2728840" d="11190">In this case, delta x moves and
x is fixed in this calculation.</p>
<p t="2740030" d="2350">All right now, in order
to simplify this, in order</p>
<p t="2742380" d="2430">to understand algebraically
what's going on,</p>
<p t="2744810" d="3620">I need to understand what
the nth power of a sum is.</p>
<p t="2748430" d="1670">And that's a famous formula.</p>
<p t="2750100" d="2450">We only need a little
tiny bit of it,</p>
<p t="2752550" d="3490">called the binomial theorem.</p>
<p t="2756040" d="10310">So, the binomial theorem
which is in your text</p>
<p t="2766350" d="6470">and explained in
an appendix, says</p>
<p t="2772820" d="3060">that if you take
the sum of two guys</p>
<p t="2775880" d="2310">and you take them to the
nth power, that of course</p>
<p t="2778190" d="6560">is (x + delta x) multiplied
by itself n times.</p>
<p t="2784750" d="5150">And so the first term is
x^n, that's when all of the n</p>
<p t="2789900" d="1790">factors come in.</p>
<p t="2791690" d="3930">And then, you could have this
factor of delta x and all</p>
<p t="2795620" d="1166">the rest x's.</p>
<p t="2796786" d="2374">So at least one term of the
form (x^(n-1)) times delta x.</p>
<p t="2801820" d="1830">And how many times
does that happen?</p>
<p t="2803650" d="2280">Well, it happens when
there's a factor from here,</p>
<p t="2805930" d="2300">from the next factor, and
so on, and so on, and so on.</p>
<p t="2808230" d="6100">There's a total of n possible
times that that happens.</p>
<p t="2814330" d="4780">And now the great thing
is that, with this alone,</p>
<p t="2819110" d="6010">all the rest of the
terms are junk that we</p>
<p t="2825120" d="1520">won't have to worry about.</p>
<p t="2826640" d="5010">So to be more specific,
there's a very careful notation</p>
<p t="2831650" d="810">for the junk.</p>
<p t="2832460" d="2380">The junk is what's called
big O of (delta x)^2.</p>
<p t="2838070" d="7670">What that means is that
these are terms of order,</p>
<p t="2845740" d="7936">so with (delta x)^2,
(delta x)^3 or higher.</p>
<p t="2853676" d="5104">All right, that's how.</p>
<p t="2858780" d="3650">Very exciting,
higher order terms.</p>
<p t="2862430" d="5110">OK, so this is the only
algebra that we need to do,</p>
<p t="2867540" d="3350">and now we just need to combine
it together to get our result.</p>
<p t="2870890" d="3860">So, now I'm going to just
carry out the cancellations</p>
<p t="2874750" d="7730">that we need.</p>
<p t="2882480" d="1310">So here we go.</p>
<p t="2883790" d="8200">We have delta f / delta x, which
remember was 1 / delta x times</p>
<p t="2891990" d="13430">this, which is this times, now
this is x^n plus nx^(n-1) delta</p>
<p t="2905420" d="9900">x plus this junk
term, minus x^n.</p>
<p t="2915320" d="3060">So that's what we
have so far based</p>
<p t="2918380" d="3290">on our previous calculations.</p>
<p t="2921670" d="6440">Now, I'm going to do the main
cancellation, which is this.</p>
<p t="2928110" d="1310">All right.</p>
<p t="2929420" d="7310">So, that's 1/delta x times
nx^(n-1) delta x plus this term</p>
<p t="2936730" d="4490">here.</p>
<p t="2941220" d="3800">And now I can divide
in by delta x.</p>
<p t="2945020" d="5510">So I get nx^(n-1) plus,
now it's O(delta x).</p>
<p t="2950530" d="1700">There's at least
one factor of delta</p>
<p t="2952230" d="2160">x not two factors of
delta x, because I</p>
<p t="2954390" d="3220">have to cancel one of them.</p>
<p t="2957610" d="2250">And now I can just
take the limit.</p>
<p t="2959860" d="2550">In the limit this
term is gonna be 0.</p>
<p t="2962410" d="3440">That's why I called
it junk originally,</p>
<p t="2965850" d="1110">because it disappears.</p>
<p t="2966960" d="4050">And in math, junk is
something that goes away.</p>
<p t="2971010" d="6340">So this tends to, as delta
x goes to 0, nx^(n-1).</p>
<p t="2977350" d="5910">And so what I've shown you is
that d/dx of x to the n minus--</p>
<p t="2983260" d="4530">sorry, n, is equal to nx^(n-1).</p>
<p t="2991180" d="2530">So now this is gonna be
super important to you</p>
<p t="2993710" d="2810">right on your problem set
in every possible way,</p>
<p t="2996520" d="2520">and I want to tell you one
thing, one way in which it's</p>
<p t="2999040" d="1160">very important.</p>
<p t="3000200" d="2040">One way that extends
it immediately.</p>
<p t="3002240" d="8710">So this thing extends
to polynomials.</p>
<p t="3010950" d="3020">We get quite a lot out
of this one calculation.</p>
<p t="3013970" d="7990">Namely, if I take d/dx of
something like (x^3 + 5x^10)</p>
<p t="3021960" d="3940">that's gonna be equal to 3x^2,
that's applying this rule</p>
<p t="3025900" d="1340">to x^3.</p>
<p t="3027240" d="7870">And then here, I'll
get 5*10 so 50x^9.</p>
<p t="3035110" d="2650">So this is the type of
thing that we get out of it,</p>
<p t="3037760" d="11967">and we're gonna make more
hay with that next time.</p>
<p t="3049727" d="500">Question.</p>
<p t="3050227" d="500">Yes.</p>
<p t="3050727" d="963">I turned myself off.</p>
<p t="3051690" d="500">Yes?</p>
<p t="3052190" d="3840">Student: [INAUDIBLE]</p>
<p t="3056030" d="5000">Professor: The question
was the binomial theorem</p>
<p t="3061030" d="3340">only works when
delta x goes to 0.</p>
<p t="3064370" d="2560">No, the binomial theorem
is a general formula</p>
<p t="3066930" d="3100">which also specifies
exactly what the junk is.</p>
<p t="3070030" d="1920">It's very much more detailed.</p>
<p t="3071950" d="1780">But we only needed this part.</p>
<p t="3073730" d="4820">We didn't care what all
these crazy terms were.</p>
<p t="3078550" d="4880">It's junk for our
purposes now, because we</p>
<p t="3083430" d="4220">don't happen to need any more
than those first two terms.</p>
<p t="3087650" d="2260">Yes, because delta x goes to 0.</p>
<p t="3089910" d="2470">OK, see you next time.</p>
