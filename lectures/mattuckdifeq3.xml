<p t="9000" d="4000">This time, we started solving
differential equations.</p>
<p t="13000" d="3072">This is the third
lecture of the term,</p>
<p t="16072" d="3928">and I have yet to solve
a single differential</p>
<p t="20000" d="2000">equation in this class.</p>
<p t="22000" d="2912">Well, that will be
rectified from now</p>
<p t="24912" d="2588">until the end of the term.</p>
<p t="27500" d="3642">So, once you learn
separation of variables,</p>
<p t="31142" d="5078">which is the most elementary
method there is, the single,</p>
<p t="36220" d="3280">I think the single
most important equation</p>
<p t="39500" d="5213">is the one that's called the
first order linear equation,</p>
<p t="44713" d="2787">both because it
occurs frequently</p>
<p t="47500" d="5225">in models because it's solvable,
and-- I think that's enough.</p>
<p t="52725" d="3608">If you drop the
course after today</p>
<p t="56333" d="3095">you will still have learned
those two important methods:</p>
<p t="59428" d="3572">separation of variables, and
first order linear equations.</p>
<p t="63000" d="3750">So, what does such an
equation look like?</p>
<p t="66750" d="2250">Well, I'll write it in there.</p>
<p t="69000" d="2331">There are several
ways of writing it,</p>
<p t="71331" d="2569">but I think the
most basic is this.</p>
<p t="73900" d="3100">I'm going to use x as
the independent variable</p>
<p t="77000" d="3000">because that's what
your book does.</p>
<p t="80000" d="2568">But in the
applications, it's often</p>
<p t="82568" d="2432">t, time, that is the
independent variable.</p>
<p t="85000" d="4000">And, I'll try to give you
examples which show that.</p>
<p t="89000" d="2000">So, the equation
looks like this.</p>
<p t="91000" d="3328">I'll find some
function of x times y</p>
<p t="94328" d="3207">prime plus some other
function of x times y</p>
<p t="97535" d="2465">is equal to yet
another function of x.</p>
<p t="100000" d="6999">Obviously, the x doesn't
have the same status</p>
<p t="106999" d="3751">here that y does, so y is
extremely limited in how</p>
<p t="110750" d="2250">it can appear in the equation.</p>
<p t="113000" d="4000">But, x can be pretty much
arbitrary in those places.</p>
<p t="117000" d="3000">So, that's the equation
we are talking about,</p>
<p t="120000" d="2270">and I'll put it up.</p>
<p t="122270" d="5226">This is the first version of
it, and we'll call them purple.</p>
<p t="127496" d="3504">Now, why is that called
the linear equation?</p>
<p t="131000" d="4998">The word linear is a
very heavily used word</p>
<p t="135998" d="2802">in mathematics, science,
and engineering.</p>
<p t="138800" d="2864">For the moment, the
best simple answer</p>
<p t="141664" d="5907">is because it's linear in y
and y prime, the variables</p>
<p t="147571" d="3429">y and y prime.</p>
<p t="151000" d="2000">Well, y prime is not a variable.</p>
<p t="153000" d="3000">Well, you will learn,
in a certain sense,</p>
<p t="156000" d="5000">it helps to think of it as
one, not right now perhaps,</p>
<p t="161000" d="2400">but think of it as linear.</p>
<p t="163400" d="4264">The most closely analogous thing
would be a linear equation,</p>
<p t="167664" d="5336">a real linear equation, the
kind you studied in high school,</p>
<p t="173000" d="2500">which would look like this.</p>
<p t="175500" d="3700">It would have two
variables, and, I guess,</p>
<p t="179200" d="2228">constant coefficients, equal c.</p>
<p t="181428" d="3572">Now, that's a linear equation.</p>
<p t="185000" d="4000">And that's the sense in
which this is linear.</p>
<p t="189000" d="3072">It's linear in y
prime and y, which</p>
<p t="192072" d="3704">are the analogs of the
variables y1 and y2.</p>
<p t="195776" d="4888">A little bit of terminology,
if c is equal to zero,</p>
<p t="200664" d="4336">it's called homogeneous, the
same way this equation is</p>
<p t="205000" d="5500">called homogeneous, as you know
from 18.02, if the right hand</p>
<p t="210500" d="1500">side is zero.</p>
<p t="212000" d="5000">So, c of x I should
write here, but I won't.</p>
<p t="217000" d="1500">That's called homogeneous.</p>
<p t="218500" d="4500">Now, this is a common
form for the equation,</p>
<p t="223000" d="4142">but it's not what it's
called standard form.</p>
<p t="227142" d="4522">The standard form for the
equation, and since this</p>
<p t="231664" d="6668">is going to be a prime course
of confusion, which is probably</p>
<p t="238332" d="5268">completely correct, but a
prime source of confusion</p>
<p t="243600" d="2400">is what I meant.</p>
<p t="246000" d="3330">The standard linear
form, and I'll</p>
<p t="249330" d="4582">underline linear is the
first co efficient of y prime</p>
<p t="253912" d="2088">is taken to be one.</p>
<p t="256000" d="4160">So, you can always convert
that to a standard form</p>
<p t="260160" d="2616">by simply dividing
through by it.</p>
<p t="262776" d="5776">And if I do that, the equation
will look like y prime plus,</p>
<p t="268552" d="6448">now, it's common to not call
it b anymore, the coefficient,</p>
<p t="275000" d="3750">because it's really b over a.</p>
<p t="278750" d="3250">And, therefore, it's
common to adopt, yet,</p>
<p t="282000" d="2000">a new letter for it.</p>
<p t="284000" d="4000">And, the standard one
that many people use is p.</p>
<p t="288000" d="2496">How about the right hand side?</p>
<p t="290496" d="2704">We needed a letter
for that, too.</p>
<p t="293200" d="2615">It's c over a, but
we'll call it q.</p>
<p t="295815" d="3850">So, when I talk about
the standard linear form</p>
<p t="299665" d="3335">for a linear first
order equation,</p>
<p t="303000" d="5000">it's absolutely that
that I'm talking about.</p>
<p t="308000" d="3000">Now, you immediately
see that there</p>
<p t="311000" d="3166">is a potential
for confusion here</p>
<p t="314166" d="7084">because what did I call the
standard form for a first order</p>
<p t="321250" d="625">equation?</p>
<p t="321875" d="4267">So, I'm going to say, not this.</p>
<p t="326142" d="5258">The standard first order
form, what would that be?</p>
<p t="331400" d="5376">Well, it would be y prime
equals, and everything else</p>
<p t="336776" d="2224">on the left hand side.</p>
<p t="339000" d="2304">So, it would be y prime.</p>
<p t="341304" d="5001">And now, if I turn this into
the standard first order form,</p>
<p t="346305" d="6695">it would be negative
p of x y plus q of x.</p>
<p t="353000" d="4750">But, of course, nobody
would write negative p of x.</p>
<p t="357750" d="2634">So, now, I explicitly
want to say</p>
<p t="360384" d="5393">that this is a form which I will
never use for this equation,</p>
<p t="365777" d="6223">although half the
books of the world do.</p>
<p t="372000" d="2400">In short, this poor little
first order equation</p>
<p t="374400" d="1725">belongs to two ethnic groups.</p>
<p t="376125" d="2250">It's both a first
order equation,</p>
<p t="378375" d="3750">and therefore, its standard
form should be written this way,</p>
<p t="382125" d="4539">but it's also a linear equation,
and therefore its standard form</p>
<p t="386664" d="1906">should be used this way.</p>
<p t="388570" d="3830">Well, it has to decide,
and I have decided for it.</p>
<p t="392400" d="3475">It is, above all, a
linear equation, not just</p>
<p t="395875" d="1725">a first order equation.</p>
<p t="397600" d="5400">And, in this course, this will
always be the standard form.</p>
<p t="403000" d="3000">Now, well, what on
earth is the difference?</p>
<p t="406000" d="3744">If you don't do it that
way, the difference</p>
<p t="409744" d="2056">is entirely in the sin(p).</p>
<p t="411800" d="5016">But, if you get the sign
of p wrong in the answers,</p>
<p t="416816" d="4184">it is just a disaster
from that point on.</p>
<p t="421000" d="4500">A trivial little change
of sign in the answer</p>
<p t="425500" d="3000">produces solutions and
functions which have</p>
<p t="428500" d="1388">totally different behavior.</p>
<p t="429888" d="4564">And, you are going to be
really lost in this course.</p>
<p t="434452" d="3436">So, maybe I should
draw a line through it</p>
<p t="437888" d="3112">to indicate, please
don't pay any attention</p>
<p t="441000" d="4856">to this whatsoever, except that
we are not going to do that.</p>
<p t="445856" d="4142">Okay, well, what's so
important about this equation?</p>
<p t="449998" d="4502">Well, number one, it
can always be solved.</p>
<p t="454500" d="4500">That's a very, very big thing
in differential equations.</p>
<p t="459000" d="2724">But, it's also
the equation which</p>
<p t="461724" d="2776">arises in a variety of models.</p>
<p t="464500" d="4400">Now, I'm just going
to list a few of them.</p>
<p t="468900" d="5327">All of them I think you will
need either in part one or part</p>
<p t="474227" d="6273">two of problem sets over these
first couple of problem sets,</p>
<p t="480500" d="3500">or second and third maybe.</p>
<p t="484000" d="7152">But, of them, I'm going to put
at the very top of the list</p>
<p t="491152" d="5648">of what I'll call here,
I'll give it two names:</p>
<p t="496800" d="4800">the temperature
diffusion model, well, it</p>
<p t="501600" d="5970">would be better to call it
temperature concentration</p>
<p t="507570" d="7430">by analogy, temperature
concentration model.</p>
<p t="515000" d="5000">There's the mixing model,
which is hardly less important.</p>
<p t="520000" d="3000">In other words, it's
almost as important.</p>
<p t="523000" d="3000">You have that in
your problem set.</p>
<p t="526000" d="6000">And then, there are other,
slightly less important models.</p>
<p t="532000" d="3000">There is the model
of radioactive decay.</p>
<p t="535000" d="5000">There's the model of a bank
interest, bank account,</p>
<p t="540000" d="4428">various motion models, you
know, Newton's Law type problems</p>
<p t="544428" d="3852">if you can figure
out a way of getting</p>
<p t="548280" d="6720">rid of the second derivative,
some motion problems.</p>
<p t="555000" d="8000">A classic example is the motion
of a rocket being fired off,</p>
<p t="563000" d="1500">etc., etc., etc.</p>
<p t="564500" d="4125">Now, today I have
to pick a model.</p>
<p t="568625" d="8575">And, the one I'm going to
pick is this temperature</p>
<p t="577200" d="2800">concentration model.</p>
<p t="580000" d="3000">So, this is going
to be today's model.</p>
<p t="583000" d="2500">Tomorrow's model
in the recitation,</p>
<p t="585500" d="4500">I'm asking the recitations
to, among other things,</p>
<p t="590000" d="4224">make sure they do a mixing
problem, A) to show you</p>
<p t="594224" d="5776">how to do it, and B) because
it's on the problem sets.</p>
<p t="600000" d="4000">That's not a good reason,
but it's not a bad one.</p>
<p t="604000" d="2688">The others are
either in part one</p>
<p t="606688" d="3764">or we will take them
up later in the term.</p>
<p t="610452" d="5548">This is not going to be the only
lecture on the linear equation.</p>
<p t="616000" d="5000">There will be another one
next week of equal importance.</p>
<p t="621000" d="3000">But, we can't do
everything today.</p>
<p t="624000" d="3500">So, let's talk about the
temperature concentration</p>
<p t="627500" d="4500">model, except I'm going
to change its name.</p>
<p t="632000" d="7000">I'm going to change its name to
the conduction diffusion model.</p>
<p t="639000" d="5000">I'll put conduction over
there, and diffusion over here,</p>
<p t="644000" d="4428">let's say, since, as you
will see, the similarities,</p>
<p t="648428" d="4000">they are practically
the same model.</p>
<p t="652428" d="3822">All that's changed
from one to the other</p>
<p t="656250" d="3750">is the name of the ideas.</p>
<p t="660000" d="3000">In one case, you
call it temperature,</p>
<p t="663000" d="3800">and the other, you should
call it concentration.</p>
<p t="666800" d="4532">But, the actual mathematics
isn't identical.</p>
<p t="671332" d="3168">So, let's begin with conduction.</p>
<p t="674500" d="4830">All right, so, I need a
simple physical situation</p>
<p t="679330" d="1670">that I'm modeling.</p>
<p t="681000" d="3000">So, imagine a tank
of some liquid.</p>
<p t="684000" d="3000">Water will do as
well as anything.</p>
<p t="687000" d="3500">And, in the inside
is a suspended,</p>
<p t="690500" d="2750">somehow, is a chamber.</p>
<p t="693250" d="5415">A metal cube will
do, and let's suppose</p>
<p t="698665" d="4667">that its walls are partly
insulated, not so much</p>
<p t="703332" d="2668">that no heat can get through.</p>
<p t="706000" d="4440">There is no such thing
as perfect insulation</p>
<p t="710440" d="5560">anyway, except maybe an
absolute perfect vacuum.</p>
<p t="716000" d="3500">Now, inside, so here on
the outside is liquid.</p>
<p t="719500" d="4900">Okay, on the inside
is, what I'm interested</p>
<p t="724400" d="5600">in is the temperature
of this thing.</p>
<p t="730000" d="3666">I'll call that T. Now, that's
different from the temperature</p>
<p t="733666" d="3334">of the external water bath.</p>
<p t="737000" d="4000">So, I'll call that T
sub e, T for temperature</p>
<p t="741000" d="4500">measured in Celsius, let's say,
for the sake of definiteness.</p>
<p t="745500" d="3125">But, this is the
external temperature.</p>
<p t="748625" d="4375">So, I'll indicate it with an e.</p>
<p t="753000" d="2775">Now, what is the model?</p>
<p t="755775" d="7553">Well, in other words, how do I
set up a differential equation</p>
<p t="763328" d="2672">to model the situation?</p>
<p t="766000" d="7000">Well, it's based on a physical
law, which I think you know,</p>
<p t="773000" d="4362">you've had simple
examples like this,</p>
<p t="777362" d="5638">the so called Newton's
Law of cooling, -- --</p>
<p t="783000" d="3545">which says that
the rate of change,</p>
<p t="786545" d="6455">the temperature of the heat goes
from the outside to the inside</p>
<p t="793000" d="1500">by conduction only.</p>
<p t="794500" d="3640">Heat, of course, can
travel in various ways,</p>
<p t="798140" d="4860">by convection, by conduction,
as here, or by radiation,</p>
<p t="803000" d="2270">are the three most common.</p>
<p t="805270" d="6062">Of these, I only want one,
namely transmission of heat</p>
<p t="811332" d="1668">by conduction.</p>
<p t="813000" d="3267">And, that's the way it's
probably a little better</p>
<p t="816267" d="4733">to call it the conduction model,
rather than the temperature</p>
<p t="821000" d="4086">model, which might involve
other ways for the heat</p>
<p t="825086" d="1514">to be traveling.</p>
<p t="826600" d="2733">So, dt, the
independent variable,</p>
<p t="829333" d="3667">is not going to be x,
as it was over there.</p>
<p t="833000" d="2688">It's going to be t for time.</p>
<p t="835688" d="3312">So, maybe I should write
that down. t equals time.</p>
<p t="839000" d="6000">Capital T equals temperature
in degrees Celsius.</p>
<p t="845000" d="3000">So, you can put in the
degrees Celsius if you want.</p>
<p t="848000" d="4375">So, it's proportional to
the temperature difference</p>
<p t="852375" d="1375">between these two.</p>
<p t="853750" d="2678">Now, how shall I
write the difference?</p>
<p t="856428" d="4572">Write it this way because if you
don't you will be in trouble.</p>
<p t="861000" d="3000">Now, why do I write it that way?</p>
<p t="864000" d="2664">Well, I write it
that way because I</p>
<p t="866664" d="5336">want this constant to be
positive, a positive constant.</p>
<p t="872000" d="3800">In general, any constant, so,
parameters which are physical,</p>
<p t="875800" d="3926">have some physical
significance, one always</p>
<p t="879726" d="4416">wants to arrange the equation so
that they are positive numbers,</p>
<p t="884142" d="3713">the way people normally
think of these things.</p>
<p t="887855" d="1745">This is called the conductivity.</p>
<p t="889600" d="2400">The conductivity of what?</p>
<p t="892000" d="2800">Well, I don't
know, of the system</p>
<p t="894800" d="3280">of the situation, the
conductivity of the wall,</p>
<p t="898080" d="3919">or the wall if the metal
were just by itself.</p>
<p t="901999" d="2333">At any rate, it's a constant.</p>
<p t="904332" d="2668">It's thought of as a constant.</p>
<p t="907000" d="4142">And, why positive, well, because
if the external temperature is</p>
<p t="911142" d="2858">bigger than the
internal temperature,</p>
<p t="914000" d="4666">I expect T to rise, the
internal temperature to rise.</p>
<p t="918666" d="5554">That means dT / dt, its
slope, should be positive.</p>
<p t="924220" d="3280">So, in other words, if
Te is bigger than T,</p>
<p t="927500" d="1875">I expect this number
to be positive.</p>
<p t="929375" d="4077">And, that tells you that k
must be a positive constant.</p>
<p t="933452" d="3548">If I had turned it the
other way, expressed</p>
<p t="937000" d="3000">the difference in
the reverse order,</p>
<p t="940000" d="4000">K would then be negative,
have to be negative in order</p>
<p t="944000" d="3000">that this turn out to be
positive in that situation I</p>
<p t="947000" d="600">described.</p>
<p t="947600" d="3600">And, since nobody wants
negative values of k,</p>
<p t="951200" d="2799">you have to write the
equation in this form</p>
<p t="953999" d="2001">rather than the
other way around.</p>
<p t="956000" d="3000">So, there's our
differential equation.</p>
<p t="959000" d="3000">It will probably have
an initial condition.</p>
<p t="962000" d="3663">So, it could be the temperature
at the starting time should</p>
<p t="965663" d="4337">be some given number, T zero.</p>
<p t="970000" d="3000">But, the condition could
be given in other ways.</p>
<p t="973000" d="2000">One can ask, what's
the temperature as time</p>
<p t="975000" d="2000">goes to infinity, for example?</p>
<p t="977000" d="4000">There are different ways of
getting that initial condition.</p>
<p t="981000" d="2000">Okay, that's the
conduction model.</p>
<p t="983000" d="2000">What would the
diffusion model be?</p>
<p t="985000" d="3142">The diffusion model,
mathematically, would be,</p>
<p t="988142" d="2858">word for word, the same.</p>
<p t="991000" d="2912">The only difference
is that now, what</p>
<p t="993912" d="4358">I imagine is I'll draw
the picture the same way,</p>
<p t="998270" d="5271">except now I'm going to put,
label the inside not with a T</p>
<p t="1003541" d="3124">but with a C, C
for concentration.</p>
<p t="1006665" d="4191">It's in an external
water bath, let's say.</p>
<p t="1010856" d="2715">So, there is an
external concentration.</p>
<p t="1013571" d="4317">And, what I'm talking
about is some chemical,</p>
<p t="1017888" d="4362">let's say salt will do
as well as anything.</p>
<p t="1022250" d="5250">So, C is equal to salt
concentration inside,</p>
<p t="1027500" d="6214">and Ce would be the salt
concentration outside,</p>
<p t="1033714" d="4286">outside in the water bath.</p>
<p t="1038000" d="8000">Now, I imagine some mechanism,
so this is a salt solution.</p>
<p t="1046000" d="2664">That's a salt solution.</p>
<p t="1048664" d="5514">And, I imagine some mechanism
by which the salt can diffuse,</p>
<p t="1054178" d="2821">it's a diffusion model
now, diffuse from here</p>
<p t="1056999" d="3001">into the air or possibly
out the other way.</p>
<p t="1060000" d="3500">And that's usually done
by vaguely referring</p>
<p t="1063500" d="3640">to the outside as a
semi permeable membrane,</p>
<p t="1067140" d="2940">semi permeable, so
that the salt will</p>
<p t="1070080" d="3670">have a little hard time
getting through but permeable,</p>
<p t="1073750" d="3050">so that it won't be
blocked completely.</p>
<p t="1076800" d="3200">So, there's a membrane.</p>
<p t="1080000" d="6000">You write the semi
permeable membrane outside,</p>
<p t="1086000" d="1713">outside the inside.</p>
<p t="1087713" d="2287">Well, I give up.</p>
<p t="1090000" d="4000">You know, membrane somewhere.</p>
<p t="1094000" d="3000">Sorry, membrane wall.</p>
<p t="1097000" d="1332">How's that?</p>
<p t="1098332" d="2668">Now, what's the equation?</p>
<p t="1101000" d="5600">Well, the equation is
the same, except it's</p>
<p t="1106600" d="2900">called the diffusion equation.</p>
<p t="1109500" d="5784">I don't think Newton
got his name on this.</p>
<p t="1115284" d="4894">The diffusion equation says
that the rate at which the salt</p>
<p t="1120178" d="2206">diffuses across
the membrane, which</p>
<p t="1122384" d="4616">is the same up to a constant
as the rate at which</p>
<p t="1127000" d="4000">the concentration inside
changes, is some constant,</p>
<p t="1131000" d="3000">usually called k still, okay.</p>
<p t="1134000" d="1332">Do I contradict?</p>
<p t="1135332" d="2668">Okay, let's keep calling it k1.</p>
<p t="1138000" d="3000">Now it's different,
times Ce minus C.</p>
<p t="1141000" d="2800">And, for the same
reason as before,</p>
<p t="1143800" d="3342">if the external
concentration is bigger</p>
<p t="1147142" d="5582">than the internal concentration,
we expect salt to flow in.</p>
<p t="1152724" d="2276">That will make C rise.</p>
<p t="1155000" d="3307">It will make this
positive, and therefore, we</p>
<p t="1158307" d="2763">want k to be positive,
just k1 to be</p>
<p t="1161070" d="3930">positive for the same reason
it had to be positive before.</p>
<p t="1165000" d="3600">So, in each case, the model
that I'm talking about</p>
<p t="1168600" d="2400">is the differential equation.</p>
<p t="1171000" d="3500">So, maybe I should, let's
put that, make that clear.</p>
<p t="1174500" d="5213">Or, I would say that this first
order differential equation</p>
<p t="1179713" d="3619">models this physical
situation, and the same thing</p>
<p t="1183332" d="2668">is true on the other
side over here.</p>
<p t="1186000" d="2800">This is the diffusion
equation, and this</p>
<p t="1188800" d="1575">is the conduction equation.</p>
<p t="1190375" d="4845">Now, if you are in any doubt
about the power of differential</p>
<p t="1195220" d="3622">equations, the point is,
when I talk about this thing,</p>
<p t="1198842" d="4033">I don't have to say which
of these I'm following.</p>
<p t="1202875" d="4409">I'll use neutral
variables like Y and X</p>
<p t="1207284" d="1716">to solve these equations.</p>
<p t="1209000" d="3600">But, with a single
stroke, I will be handling</p>
<p t="1212600" d="1150">those situations together.</p>
<p t="1213750" d="2750">And, that's the
power of the method.</p>
<p t="1216500" d="3700">Now, you obviously must
be wondering, look,</p>
<p t="1220200" d="2466">these look very, very special.</p>
<p t="1222666" d="4474">He said he was going to talk
about the first, general first</p>
<p t="1227140" d="860">order equation.</p>
<p t="1228000" d="3000">But, these look
rather special to me.</p>
<p t="1231000" d="2220">Well, not too special.</p>
<p t="1233220" d="2780">How should we write it?</p>
<p t="1236000" d="5332">Suppose I write, let's take
the temperature equation just</p>
<p t="1241332" d="2668">to have something definite.</p>
<p t="1244000" d="4000">Notice that it's in a form
corresponding to Newton's Law.</p>
<p t="1248000" d="4000">But it is not in the
standard linear form.</p>
<p t="1252000" d="2688">Let's put it in
standard linear form,</p>
<p t="1254688" d="4392">so at least you could see
that it's a linear equation.</p>
<p t="1259080" d="3304">So, if I put it
in standard form,</p>
<p t="1262384" d="3840">it's going to look like
DTDTD little t plus KT</p>
<p t="1266224" d="2996">is equal to K times TE.</p>
<p t="1269220" d="3980">Now, compare that with
the general, the way</p>
<p t="1273200" d="2800">the general equation
is supposed to look,</p>
<p t="1276000" d="4000">the yellow box over there,
the standard linear form.</p>
<p t="1280000" d="1998">How are they going to compare?</p>
<p t="1281998" d="2502">Well, this is a pretty
general function.</p>
<p t="1284500" d="1500">This is general.</p>
<p t="1286000" d="3840">This is a general function
of T because I can</p>
<p t="1289840" d="1588">make the external temperature.</p>
<p t="1291428" d="5572">I could suppose it behaves in
anyway I like, steadily rising,</p>
<p t="1297000" d="2000">decaying exponentially,
maybe oscillating</p>
<p t="1299000" d="3180">back and forth for some reason.</p>
<p t="1302180" d="4320">The only way in which
it's not general</p>
<p t="1306500" d="3500">is that this K is a constant.</p>
<p t="1310000" d="3000">So, I will ask you
to be generous.</p>
<p t="1313000" d="4000">Let's imagine the conductivity
is changing over time.</p>
<p t="1317000" d="3815">So, this is usually
constant, but there's</p>
<p t="1320815" d="4405">no law which says it has to be.</p>
<p t="1325220" d="3922">How could a conductivity
change over time?</p>
<p t="1329142" d="3746">Well, we could
suppose that this wall</p>
<p t="1332888" d="4254">was made of slowly congealing
Jell O, for instance.</p>
<p t="1337142" d="5858">It starts out as liquid,
and then it gets solid.</p>
<p t="1343000" d="3444">And, Jell O doesn't
transmit heat,</p>
<p t="1346444" d="5736">I believe, quite as well as
liquid does, as a liquid would.</p>
<p t="1352180" d="3820">Is Jell O a solid or liquid?</p>
<p t="1356000" d="1713">I don't know.</p>
<p t="1357713" d="2287">Let's forget about that.</p>
<p t="1360000" d="6000">So, with this understanding,
so let's say not necessarily</p>
<p t="1366000" d="5500">here, but not necessarily, I
can think of this, therefore,</p>
<p t="1371500" d="3500">by allowing K to vary with time.</p>
<p t="1375000" d="5000">And the external temperature
to vary with time.</p>
<p t="1380000" d="7000">I can think of it as a
general, linear equation.</p>
<p t="1387000" d="2000">So, these models
are not special.</p>
<p t="1389000" d="1452">They are fairly general.</p>
<p t="1390452" d="3832">Well, I did promise you I
would solve an equation,</p>
<p t="1394284" d="3716">and that this lecture, I still
have not solved any equations.</p>
<p t="1398000" d="3000">OK, time to stop
temporizing and solve.</p>
<p t="1401000" d="3000">So, I'm going to, in order
not to play favorites</p>
<p t="1404000" d="3000">with these two models,
I'll go back to,</p>
<p t="1407000" d="4000">and to get you used to thinking
of the variables all the time,</p>
<p t="1411000" d="4444">that is, you know, be eclectic
switching from one variable</p>
<p t="1415444" d="3108">to another according to
which particular lecture</p>
<p t="1418552" d="4083">you happened to be sitting in.</p>
<p t="1422635" d="10077">So, let's take our equation in
the form, Y prime plus P of XY,</p>
<p t="1432712" d="5288">the general form using
the old variables</p>
<p t="1438000" d="6000">equals Q of X. Solve me.</p>
<p t="1444000" d="2928">Well, there are different ways
of describing the solution</p>
<p t="1446928" d="500">process.</p>
<p t="1447428" d="3186">No matter how you
do it, it amounts</p>
<p t="1450614" d="3070">to the same amount of
work and there is always</p>
<p t="1453684" d="2647">a trick involved
at each one of them</p>
<p t="1456331" d="2794">since you can't suppress
a trick by doing</p>
<p t="1459125" d="1875">the problem some other way.</p>
<p t="1461000" d="3000">The way I'm going to do
it, I think, is the best.</p>
<p t="1464000" d="2000">That's why I'm giving it to you.</p>
<p t="1466000" d="1815">It's the easiest to remember.</p>
<p t="1467815" d="3185">It leads to the
least work, but I</p>
<p t="1471000" d="5000">have colleagues who would
fight with me about that point.</p>
<p t="1476000" d="3330">So, since they are not
here to fight with me</p>
<p t="1479330" d="3002">I am free to do whatever I like.</p>
<p t="1482332" d="3068">One of the main
reasons for doing</p>
<p t="1485400" d="4000">it the way I'm going
to do is because I</p>
<p t="1489400" d="6155">want you to get what our word
into your consciousness, two</p>
<p t="1495555" d="1665">words, integrating factor.</p>
<p t="1497220" d="5280">I'm going to solve this equation
by finding and integrating</p>
<p t="1502500" d="6500">factor of the form U of X.
What's an integrating factor?</p>
<p t="1509000" d="4000">Well, I'll show you not by
writing an elaborate definition</p>
<p t="1513000" d="3666">on the board, but showing
you what its function is.</p>
<p t="1516666" d="2666">It's a certain
function, U of X, I</p>
<p t="1519332" d="3868">don't know what it is, but
here's what I wanted to do.</p>
<p t="1523200" d="3563">I want to multiply, I'm going
to drop the X's a just so</p>
<p t="1526763" d="2347">that the thing looks
less complicated.</p>
<p t="1529110" d="5015">So, what I want to do is
multiply this equation</p>
<p t="1534125" d="1875">through by U of X.</p>
<p t="1536000" d="4360">That's why it's called
a factor because you're</p>
<p t="1540360" d="3456">going to multiply
everything through by it.</p>
<p t="1543816" d="5404">So, it's going to look like
UY prime plus PUY equals QU,</p>
<p t="1549220" d="3556">and now, so far,
it's just a factor.</p>
<p t="1552776" d="2599">What makes it an
integrating factor</p>
<p t="1555375" d="5391">is that this, after I do
that, I want this to turn out</p>
<p t="1560766" d="3734">to be the derivative of
something with respect</p>
<p t="1564500" d="3750">to X. You see the
motivation for that.</p>
<p t="1568250" d="2875">If this turns out to be the
derivative of something,</p>
<p t="1571125" d="2238">because I've chosen
U so cleverly,</p>
<p t="1573363" d="3637">then I will be able to solve
the equation immediately</p>
<p t="1577000" d="2000">just by integrating
this with respect to X,</p>
<p t="1579000" d="2000">and integrating that
with respect to X.</p>
<p t="1581000" d="3750">You just, then, integrate
both sides with respect to X,</p>
<p t="1584750" d="1250">and the equation is solved.</p>
<p t="1586000" d="5000">Now, the only question is,
what should I choose for U?</p>
<p t="1591000" d="3000">Well, if you think of
the product formula,</p>
<p t="1594000" d="3000">there might be many
things to try here.</p>
<p t="1597000" d="3000">But there's only one
reasonable thing to try.</p>
<p t="1600000" d="5000">Try to pick U so that it's
the derivative of U times Y.</p>
<p t="1605000" d="1665">See how reasonable that is?</p>
<p t="1606665" d="2668">If I use the product
rule on this,</p>
<p t="1609333" d="2667">the first term is
U times Y prime.</p>
<p t="1612000" d="4000">The second term would
be U prime times Y.</p>
<p t="1616000" d="3000">Well, I've got the Y there.</p>
<p t="1619000" d="2000">So, this will work.</p>
<p t="1621000" d="4888">It works if, what's the
condition that you must satisfy</p>
<p t="1625888" d="3112">in order for that to be true?</p>
<p t="1629000" d="6000">Well, it must be that after
it to the differentiation,</p>
<p t="1635000" d="4000">U prime turns out
to be P times U.</p>
<p t="1639000" d="1816">So, is it clear?</p>
<p t="1640816" d="5809">This is something we want to be
equal to, and the thing I will</p>
<p t="1646625" d="5706">try to do it is by
choosing U in such a way</p>
<p t="1652331" d="4669">that this equality
will take place.</p>
<p t="1657000" d="3000">And then I will be able
to solve the equation.</p>
<p t="1660000" d="3000">And so, here's what my
U prime must satisfy.</p>
<p t="1663000" d="1815">Hey, we can solve that.</p>
<p t="1664815" d="2407">But please don't
forget that P is</p>
<p t="1667222" d="1778">P of X. It's a function of X.</p>
<p t="1669000" d="4000">So, if you separate variables,
I'm going to do this.</p>
<p t="1673000" d="3600">So, what is it, DU over
U equals P of X times DX.</p>
<p t="1676600" d="3900">If I integrate that,
so, separate variables,</p>
<p t="1680500" d="4165">integrate, and you're going
to get DU over U integrates</p>
<p t="1684665" d="3763">to the be the log of
U, and the other side</p>
<p t="1688428" d="3572">integrates to be the
integral of P of X DX.</p>
<p t="1692000" d="4000">Now, you can put an
arbitrary constant there,</p>
<p t="1696000" d="2448">or you can think of
it as already implied</p>
<p t="1698448" d="1694">by the indefinite integral.</p>
<p t="1700142" d="4358">Well, that doesn't tell
us, yet, what U is.</p>
<p t="1704500" d="1500">What should U be?</p>
<p t="1706000" d="4250">Notice, I don't have to find
every possible U, which works.</p>
<p t="1710250" d="3750">All I'm looking for is one.</p>
<p t="1714000" d="4000">All I want is a single view
which satisfies that equation.</p>
<p t="1718000" d="4000">Well, U equals the integral,
E to the integral of PDX.</p>
<p t="1722000" d="2500">That's not too
beautiful looking,</p>
<p t="1724500" d="2226">but by differential
equations, things</p>
<p t="1726726" d="3728">can get so complicated
that in a week or two,</p>
<p t="1730454" d="4546">you will think of this as
an extremely simple formula.</p>
<p t="1735000" d="5000">So, there is a formula for
our integrating factor.</p>
<p t="1740000" d="1500">We found it.</p>
<p t="1741500" d="5750">We will always be able to
write an integrating factor.</p>
<p t="1747250" d="7500">Don't worry about the arbitrary
constant because you only need</p>
<p t="1754750" d="2250">one such U.</p>
<p t="1757000" d="6000">So: no arbitrary constant
since only one U needed.</p>
<p t="1763000" d="3600">And, that's the
solution, the way</p>
<p t="1766600" d="3600">we solve the linear equation.</p>
<p t="1770200" d="7344">OK, let's take over,
and actually do it.</p>
<p t="1777544" d="6170">I think it would be
better to summarize it</p>
<p t="1783714" d="4286">as a clear cut method.</p>
<p t="1788000" d="3000">So, let's do that.</p>
<p t="1791000" d="3000">So, what's our method?</p>
<p t="1794000" d="10000">It's the method for solving
Y prime plus PY equals Q.</p>
<p t="1804000" d="3800">Well, the first place, make sure
it's in standard linear form.</p>
<p t="1807800" d="3531">If it isn't, you must
put it in that form.</p>
<p t="1811331" d="3381">Notice, the formula for the
integrating factor, the formula</p>
<p t="1814712" d="2144">for the integrating
factor involves</p>
<p t="1816856" d="2144">P, the integral of PDX.</p>
<p t="1819000" d="2000">So, you'd better
get the right P.</p>
<p t="1821000" d="1600">Otherwise, you are sunk.</p>
<p t="1822600" d="3150">OK, so put it in
standard linear form.</p>
<p t="1825750" d="3582">That way, you will have
the right P. Notice</p>
<p t="1829332" d="3212">that if you wrote
it in that form,</p>
<p t="1832544" d="2831">and all you remembered
was E to the integral PDX,</p>
<p t="1835375" d="2625">the P would have the wrong sign.</p>
<p t="1838000" d="3070">If you're going to write, that
P should have a negative sign</p>
<p t="1841070" d="500">there.</p>
<p t="1841570" d="2930">So, do it this way,
and no other way.</p>
<p t="1844500" d="3165">Otherwise, you will get
confused and get wrong signs.</p>
<p t="1847665" d="3666">And, as I say, that will
produce wrong answers, and not</p>
<p t="1851331" d="2669">just slightly wrong
answers, but disastrously</p>
<p t="1854000" d="3664">wrong answers from the point
of view of the modeling</p>
<p t="1857664" d="4444">if you really want answers
to physical problems.</p>
<p t="1862108" d="4492">So, here's a
standard linear form.</p>
<p t="1866600" d="3066">Then, find the
integrating factor.</p>
<p t="1869666" d="7334">So, calculate E to the integral,
PDX, the integrating factor,</p>
<p t="1877000" d="5000">and that multiply both,
I'm putting this as both,</p>
<p t="1882000" d="9000">underlined that as many times
as you have room in your notes.</p>
<p t="1891000" d="7362">Multiply both sides by this
integrating factor by E</p>
<p t="1898362" d="4038">to the integral PDX.</p>
<p t="1902400" d="3600">And then, integrate.</p>
<p t="1906000" d="5000">OK, let's take a simple example.</p>
<p t="1911000" d="6400">Suppose we started with
the equation XY prime</p>
<p t="1917400" d="8600">minus Y equals, I had X2,
X3, something like that,</p>
<p t="1926000" d="6000">X3, I think, yeah, X2.</p>
<p t="1932000" d="4000">OK, what's the
first thing to do?</p>
<p t="1936000" d="2915">Put it in standard form.</p>
<p t="1938915" d="7000">So, step zero will be to
write it as Y prime minus</p>
<p t="1945915" d="4085">one over X times Y equals X2.</p>
<p t="1950000" d="4833">Let's do the work first, and
then I'll talk about mistakes.</p>
<p t="1954833" d="5055">Well, we now calculate
the integrating factor.</p>
<p t="1959888" d="3112">So, I would do it in steps.</p>
<p t="1963000" d="5000">You can integrate negative
one over X, right?</p>
<p t="1968000" d="3500">That integrates to
minus log X. So,</p>
<p t="1971500" d="5500">the integrating factor is E
to the integral of this, DX.</p>
<p t="1977000" d="5000">So, it's E to the
negative log X.</p>
<p t="1982000" d="4500">Now, in real life, that's
not the way to leave that.</p>
<p t="1986500" d="3833">What is E to the negative log X?</p>
<p t="1990333" d="5667">Well, think of it as E to
the log X to the minus one.</p>
<p t="1996000" d="5570">Or, in other words, it is
E to the log X is X. So,</p>
<p t="2001570" d="1430">it's one over X.</p>
<p t="2003000" d="4000">So, the integrating
factor is one over X.</p>
<p t="2007000" d="7000">OK, multiply both sides
by the integrating factor.</p>
<p t="2014000" d="1500">Both sides of what?</p>
<p t="2015500" d="5500">Both sides of this: the equation
written in standard form,</p>
<p t="2021000" d="1200">and both sides.</p>
<p t="2022200" d="5600">So, it's going to be one over
XY prime minus one over X2 Y</p>
<p t="2027800" d="5015">is equal to X2 times one over
X, which is simply X. Now,</p>
<p t="2032815" d="2730">if you have done
the work correctly,</p>
<p t="2035545" d="5455">you should be able, now,
to integrate the left hand</p>
<p t="2041000" d="1110">side directly.</p>
<p t="2042110" d="4318">So, I'm going to
write it this way.</p>
<p t="2046428" d="4387">I always recommend that you
put it as extra step, well,</p>
<p t="2050815" d="3327">put it as an extra
step the reason</p>
<p t="2054142" d="2858">for using that
integrating factor,</p>
<p t="2057000" d="4200">in other words, that the left
hand side is supposed to be,</p>
<p t="2061200" d="2800">now, one over X times Y prime.</p>
<p t="2064000" d="3328">I always put it that
because there's always</p>
<p t="2067328" d="4447">a chance you made a mistake
or forgot something.</p>
<p t="2071775" d="2780">Look at it, mentally
differentiated</p>
<p t="2074555" d="5300">using the product rule just
to check that, in fact, it</p>
<p t="2079855" d="3145">turns out to be the same
as the left hand side.</p>
<p t="2083000" d="1535">So, what do we get?</p>
<p t="2084535" d="3965">One over X times Y prime
plus Y times the derivative</p>
<p t="2088500" d="5300">of one over X, which indeed
is negative one over X2.</p>
<p t="2093800" d="4200">And now, finally, that's 3A,
continue, do the integration.</p>
<p t="2098000" d="2149">So, you're going
to get, let's see</p>
<p t="2100149" d="4755">if we can do it all on one
board, one over X times Y</p>
<p t="2104904" d="3000">is equal to X plus a
constant, X, sorry, X2</p>
<p t="2107904" d="1953">over two plus a constant.</p>
<p t="2109857" d="6475">And, the final step
will be, therefore, now</p>
<p t="2116332" d="4668">I want to isolate Y by itself.</p>
<p t="2121000" d="5000">So, Y will be equal to
multiply through by X.</p>
<p t="2126000" d="8000">X3 over two plus C times X.
And, that's the solution.</p>
<p t="2134000" d="6000">OK, let's do one a little
slightly more complicated.</p>
<p t="2140000" d="1816">Let's try this one.</p>
<p t="2141816" d="3729">Now, my equation
is going to be one,</p>
<p t="2145545" d="5455">I'll still keep two, Y
and X, as the variables.</p>
<p t="2151000" d="6000">I'll use T and F
for a minute or two.</p>
<p t="2157000" d="4360">One plus cosine X,
so, I'm not going</p>
<p t="2161360" d="5640">to give you this one in
standard form either.</p>
<p t="2167000" d="2332">It's a trick question.</p>
<p t="2169332" d="8000">Y prime minus sine X times Y is
equal to anything reasonable,</p>
<p t="2177332" d="1668">I guess.</p>
<p t="2179000" d="5000">I think X, 2X, make
it more exciting.</p>
<p t="2184000" d="4920">OK, now, I think
I should warn you</p>
<p t="2188920" d="9080">where the mistakes are just so
that you can make all of them.</p>
<p t="2198000" d="3000">So, this is mistake number one.</p>
<p t="2201000" d="3750">You don't put it
in standard form.</p>
<p t="2204750" d="6250">Mistake number two: generally
people can do step one fine.</p>
<p t="2211000" d="6000">Mistake number two is, this
is my most common mistake,</p>
<p t="2217000" d="3000">so I'm very sensitive to it.</p>
<p t="2220000" d="3750">But that doesn't
mean if you make it,</p>
<p t="2223750" d="2250">you'll get any sympathy from me.</p>
<p t="2226000" d="2000">I don't give sympathy to myself.</p>
<p t="2228000" d="2400">You are so intense,
so happy at having</p>
<p t="2230400" d="1932">found the integrating
factor, you</p>
<p t="2232332" d="4000">forget to multiply Q by the
integrating factor also.</p>
<p t="2236332" d="4000">You just handle the left
hand side of the equation,</p>
<p t="2240332" d="2667">if you forget about
the right hand side.</p>
<p t="2242999" d="4221">So, the emphasis on the
both here is the right hand,</p>
<p t="2247220" d="1780">please include the Q.</p>
<p t="2249000" d="4000">Please include the
right hand side.</p>
<p t="2253000" d="1332">Any other mistakes?</p>
<p t="2254332" d="2918">Well, nothing that
I can think of.</p>
<p t="2257250" d="2414">Well, maybe only,
anyway, we are not</p>
<p t="2259664" d="3906">going to make any mistakes
the rest of this lecture.</p>
<p t="2263570" d="1430">So, what do we do?</p>
<p t="2265000" d="2304">We write this in standard form.</p>
<p t="2267304" d="4296">So, it's going to look
like Y prime minus sine X,</p>
<p t="2271600" d="4216">sine X divided by one
plus cosine X times Y</p>
<p t="2275816" d="3184">equals, my heart
sinks because I know</p>
<p t="2279000" d="5000">I'm supposed to integrate
something like this.</p>
<p t="2284000" d="3000">And, boy, that's going
to give me problems.</p>
<p t="2287000" d="1713">Well, not yet.</p>
<p t="2288713" d="2287">With the integrating factor?</p>
<p t="2291000" d="3000">The integrating
factor is, well, we</p>
<p t="2294000" d="4220">want to calculate the
integral of negative sine X</p>
<p t="2298220" d="1780">over one plus cosine.</p>
<p t="2300000" d="1875">That's the integral of PDX.</p>
<p t="2301875" d="3625">And, after that, we
have to exponentiate it.</p>
<p t="2305500" d="2500">Well, can you do this?</p>
<p t="2308000" d="3000">Yeah, but if you stare
at it a little while,</p>
<p t="2311000" d="7000">you can see that the top is
the derivative of the bottom.</p>
<p t="2318000" d="1332">That is great.</p>
<p t="2319332" d="4268">That means it integrates
to be the log of one</p>
<p t="2323600" d="3762">plus cosine X. Is that
right, one over one</p>
<p t="2327362" d="4263">plus cosine X times the
derivative of this, which</p>
<p t="2331625" d="4750">is negative cosine X. Therefore,
the integrating factor</p>
<p t="2336375" d="1500">is E to that.</p>
<p t="2337875" d="4395">In other words, it
is one plus cosine X.</p>
<p t="2342270" d="3230">Therefore, so this
was step zero.</p>
<p t="2345500" d="3832">Step one, we found the
integrating factor.</p>
<p t="2349332" d="7668">And now, step two, we multiply
through the integrating factor.</p>
<p t="2357000" d="2220">And what do we get?</p>
<p t="2359220" d="3922">We multiply through the
standard for equation</p>
<p t="2363142" d="5858">by the integrating factor, if
you do that, what you get is,</p>
<p t="2369000" d="6000">well, Y prime gets the
coefficient one plus cosine X,</p>
<p t="2375000" d="3885">Y prime minus sign X equals 2X.</p>
<p t="2378885" d="1115">Oh, dear.</p>
<p t="2380000" d="5000">Well, I hope somebody
would giggle at this point.</p>
<p t="2385000" d="2270">What's giggle able about it?</p>
<p t="2387270" d="3730">Well, that all this was
totally wasted work.</p>
<p t="2391000" d="2500">It's called spinning
your wheels.</p>
<p t="2393500" d="3000">No, it's not
spinning your wheels.</p>
<p t="2396500" d="3500">It's doing what
you're supposed to do,</p>
<p t="2400000" d="5000">and finding out that you
wasted the entire time doing</p>
<p t="2405000" d="3000">what you were supposed to do.</p>
<p t="2408000" d="4140">Well, in other words,
that net effect of this</p>
<p t="2412140" d="4716">is to end up with the same
equation we started with.</p>
<p t="2416856" d="2144">But, what is the point?</p>
<p t="2419000" d="3178">The point of having
done all this</p>
<p t="2422178" d="4597">was because now the left
hand side is exactly</p>
<p t="2426775" d="5495">the derivative of something,
and the left hand side should</p>
<p t="2432270" d="2730">be the derivative of what?</p>
<p t="2435000" d="2904">Well, it should be
the derivative of one</p>
<p t="2437904" d="2696">plus cosine X
times Y, all prime.</p>
<p t="2440600" d="4176">Now, you can check that
that's in fact the case.</p>
<p t="2444776" d="4039">It's one plus cosine X,
Y prime, plus minus sine</p>
<p t="2448815" d="3041">X, the derivative of
this side times Y.</p>
<p t="2451856" d="4364">So, if you had thought, in
looking at the equation,</p>
<p t="2456220" d="4504">to say to yourself, this
is a derivative of that,</p>
<p t="2460724" d="3524">maybe I'll just check
right away to see</p>
<p t="2464248" d="4323">if it's the derivative of
one plus cosine X sine.</p>
<p t="2468571" d="3429">You would have saved that work.</p>
<p t="2472000" d="4000">Well, you don't have to
be brilliant or clever,</p>
<p t="2476000" d="1332">or anything like that.</p>
<p t="2477332" d="2868">You can follow your
nose, and it's just,</p>
<p t="2480200" d="4675">I want to give you a positive
experience in solving</p>
<p t="2484875" d="3125">linear equations,
not too negative.</p>
<p t="2488000" d="3000">Anyway, so we got to this point.</p>
<p t="2491000" d="6000">So, now this is 2X, and
now we are ready to solve</p>
<p t="2497000" d="6500">the equation, which is the
solution now will be one plus</p>
<p t="2503500" d="5500">cosine X times Y is equal
to X2 plus a constant,</p>
<p t="2509000" d="6524">and so Y is equal to X2 divided
by X2 plus a constant divided</p>
<p t="2515524" d="5876">by one plus cosine X. Suppose
I have given you an initial</p>
<p t="2521400" d="1600">condition, which I didn't.</p>
<p t="2523000" d="4000">But, suppose the initial
condition said that Y of zero</p>
<p t="2527000" d="1332">were one, for instance.</p>
<p t="2528332" d="3333">Then, the solution would
be, so, this is an if,</p>
<p t="2531665" d="3833">I'm throwing in at the end just
to make it a little bit more</p>
<p t="2535498" d="1902">of a problem, how
would I put, then</p>
<p t="2537400" d="4000">I could evaluate the constant
by using the initial condition.</p>
<p t="2541400" d="1600">What would it be?</p>
<p t="2543000" d="2454">This would be, on the
left hand side, one,</p>
<p t="2545454" d="4546">on the right hand side
would be C over two.</p>
<p t="2550000" d="4000">So, I would get one
equals C over two.</p>
<p t="2554000" d="1875">Is that correct?</p>
<p t="2555875" d="6305">Cosine of zero is one,
so that's two down below.</p>
<p t="2562180" d="6676">Therefore, C is equal to
two, and that would then</p>
<p t="2568856" d="2144">complete the solution.</p>
<p t="2571000" d="6000">We would be X2 plus two
over one plus cosine X.</p>
<p t="2577000" d="6000">Now, you can do this
in general, of course,</p>
<p t="2583000" d="3180">and get a general formula.</p>
<p t="2586180" d="5532">And, we will have occasion
to use that next week.</p>
<p t="2591712" d="3508">But for now, why
don't we concentrate</p>
<p t="2595220" d="3335">on the most interesting
case, namely</p>
<p t="2598555" d="3330">that of the most
linear equation,</p>
<p t="2601885" d="2447">with constant
coefficient, that is,</p>
<p t="2604332" d="3382">so let's look at
the linear equation</p>
<p t="2607714" d="3570">with constant coefficient,
because that's</p>
<p t="2611284" d="5716">the one that most closely models
the conduction and diffusion</p>
<p t="2617000" d="666">equations.</p>
<p t="2617666" d="5334">So, what I'm interested in, is
since this is the, of them all,</p>
<p t="2623000" d="2400">probably it's the
most important case</p>
<p t="2625400" d="3100">is the one where P
is a constant because</p>
<p t="2628500" d="1500">of its application to that.</p>
<p t="2630000" d="3500">And, many of the other, the
bank account, for example,</p>
<p t="2633500" d="2166">all of those will use
a constant coefficient.</p>
<p t="2635666" d="2762">So, how is the
thing going to look?</p>
<p t="2638428" d="2572">Well, I will use the cooling.</p>
<p t="2641000" d="4000">Let's use the temperature
model, for example.</p>
<p t="2645000" d="2220">The temperature
model, the equation</p>
<p t="2647220" d="3380">will be DTDT plus
KT is equal to.</p>
<p t="2650600" d="4200">Now, notice on the right hand
side, this is a common error.</p>
<p t="2654800" d="1200">You don't put TE.</p>
<p t="2656000" d="5000">You have to put KTE because
that's what the equation says.</p>
<p t="2661000" d="4000">If you think units, you
won't have any trouble.</p>
<p t="2665000" d="5000">Units have to be compatible on
both sides of a differential</p>
<p t="2670000" d="666">equation.</p>
<p t="2670666" d="3665">And therefore, whatever the
units were for capital KT,</p>
<p t="2674331" d="4210">I'd have to have the same
units on the right hand side,</p>
<p t="2678541" d="4123">which indicates I cannot have KT
on the left of the differential</p>
<p t="2682664" d="2334">equation, and just
T on the right,</p>
<p t="2684998" d="2502">and expect the units
to be compatible.</p>
<p t="2687500" d="1500">That's not possible.</p>
<p t="2689000" d="2100">So, that's a good
way of remembering</p>
<p t="2691100" d="2900">that if you're modeling
temperature or concentration,</p>
<p t="2694000" d="3000">you have to have
the K on both sides.</p>
<p t="2697000" d="5080">OK, let's do, now, a lot of this
we are going to do in our head</p>
<p t="2702080" d="2920">now because this
is really too easy.</p>
<p t="2705000" d="2220">What's the integrating factor?</p>
<p t="2707220" d="6007">Well, the integrating factor is
going to be the integral of K,</p>
<p t="2713227" d="2773">the coefficient now is just K.</p>
<p t="2716000" d="5284">P is a constant, K, and if
I integrate KDT, I get KT,</p>
<p t="2721284" d="1716">and I exponentiate that.</p>
<p t="2723000" d="5000">So, the integrating
factor is E to the KT.</p>
<p t="2728000" d="6000">I multiply through both sides,
multiply by E to the KT,</p>
<p t="2734000" d="4000">and what's the
resulting equation?</p>
<p t="2738000" d="6333">Well, it's going to be , I'll
write it in the compact form.</p>
<p t="2744333" d="5667">It's going to be E to the
KT times T, all prime.</p>
<p t="2750000" d="5284">The differentiation is now,
of course, with respect</p>
<p t="2755284" d="1716">to the time.</p>
<p t="2757000" d="3750">And, that's equal
to KTE, whatever</p>
<p t="2760750" d="3975">that is, times E to the KT.</p>
<p t="2764725" d="4275">This is a function
of T, of course,</p>
<p t="2769000" d="4500">the function of little
time, sorry, little T time.</p>
<p t="2773500" d="4500">OK, and now, finally, we
are going to integrate.</p>
<p t="2778000" d="1332">What's the answer?</p>
<p t="2779332" d="6892">Well, it is E to the, so, are we
going to get E to the KT times</p>
<p t="2786224" d="5526">T is, sorry, K little t, K
times time times the temperature</p>
<p t="2791750" d="5250">is equal to the integral of KTE.</p>
<p t="2797000" d="3840">I'll put the fact that
it's a function of T</p>
<p t="2800840" d="3158">inside just to remind
you, E to the KT,</p>
<p t="2803998" d="2502">and now I'll put the
arbitrary constant.</p>
<p t="2806500" d="3642">Let's put in the arbitrary
constant explicitly.</p>
<p t="2810142" d="2858">So, what will T be?</p>
<p t="2813000" d="3000">OK, T will look
like this, finally.</p>
<p t="2816000" d="3000">It will be E to the negative KT.</p>
<p t="2819000" d="2500">That's on the outside.</p>
<p t="2821500" d="2500">Then, you will integrate.</p>
<p t="2824000" d="3552">Of course, the difficulty
of doing this integral</p>
<p t="2827552" d="4448">depends entirely upon how this
external temperature varies.</p>
<p t="2832000" d="4726">But anyways, it's going to be
K times that function, which</p>
<p t="2836726" d="3274">I haven't specified,
E to the KT plus C</p>
<p t="2840000" d="2664">times E to the negative KT.</p>
<p t="2842664" d="4336">Now, some people, many, in
fact, that almost always,</p>
<p t="2847000" d="3750">in the engineering
literature, almost never</p>
<p t="2850750" d="5535">write indefinite integrals
because an indefinite integral</p>
<p t="2856285" d="1715">is indefinite.</p>
<p t="2858000" d="2400">In other words, this covers
not just one function,</p>
<p t="2860400" d="2400">but a whole multitude
of functions</p>
<p t="2862800" d="3200">which differ from each other
by an arbitrary constant.</p>
<p t="2866000" d="3000">So, in a formula like this,
there's a certain vagueness,</p>
<p t="2869000" d="2541">and it's further
compounded by the fact</p>
<p t="2871541" d="3459">that I don't know whether the
arbitrary constant is here.</p>
<p t="2875000" d="3571">I seem to have put it explicitly
on the outside the way</p>
<p t="2878571" d="3429">you're used to
doing from calculus.</p>
<p t="2882000" d="2570">Many people, therefore,
prefer, and I</p>
<p t="2884570" d="1995">think you should
learn this, to do</p>
<p t="2886565" d="5320">what is done in the very first
section of the notes called</p>
<p t="2891885" d="1615">definite integral solutions.</p>
<p t="2893500" d="2900">If there's an initial
condition saying</p>
<p t="2896400" d="2800">that the internal
temperature at time zero</p>
<p t="2899200" d="3712">is some given value,
what they like to do</p>
<p t="2902912" d="3336">is make this thing definite
by integrating here</p>
<p t="2906248" d="4377">from zero to T, and making
this a dummy variable.</p>
<p t="2910625" d="5647">You see, what that
does is it gives you</p>
<p t="2916272" d="3180">a particular
function, whereas, I'm</p>
<p t="2919452" d="5314">sorry I didn't put in
the DT one minus two.</p>
<p t="2924766" d="4788">What it does is that
when time is zero,</p>
<p t="2929554" d="3108">all this automatically
disappears,</p>
<p t="2932662" d="7338">and the arbitrary constant
will then be, it's T.</p>
<p t="2940000" d="3125">So, in other words, C
times this, which is one,</p>
<p t="2943125" d="1875">is that equal to [T?].</p>
<p t="2945000" d="2000">In other words, if
I make this zero,</p>
<p t="2947000" d="5000">that I can write C as equal to
this arbitrary starting value.</p>
<p t="2952000" d="3000">Now, when you do this,
the essential thing,</p>
<p t="2955000" d="3000">and we're going to come
back to this next week,</p>
<p t="2958000" d="3000">but right away,
because K is positive,</p>
<p t="2961000" d="4400">I want to emphasize that so much
at the beginning of the period,</p>
<p t="2965400" d="5028">I want to conclude by showing
you what its significance is.</p>
<p t="2970428" d="4904">This part disappears
because K is positive.</p>
<p t="2975332" d="2668">The conductivity is positive.</p>
<p t="2978000" d="3000">This part disappears
as T goes to zero.</p>
<p t="2981000" d="4000">This goes to zero as
T goes to infinity.</p>
<p t="2985000" d="3000">So, this is a
solution that remains.</p>
<p t="2988000" d="4625">This, therefore, is called
the steady state solution,</p>
<p t="2992625" d="4375">the thing which the
temperature behaves like,</p>
<p t="2997000" d="2000">as T goes to infinity.</p>
<p t="2999000" d="2000">This is called the transient.</p>
<p t="3001000" d="6000">because it disappears
as T goes to infinity.</p>
<p t="3007000" d="2664">It depends on the
initial condition,</p>
<p t="3009664" d="2536">but it disappears,
which shows you,</p>
<p t="3012200" d="4465">then, in the long run
for this type of problem</p>
<p t="3016665" d="3335">the initial condition
makes no difference.</p>
<p t="3020000" d="4550">The function behaves always the
same way as T goes to infinity.</p>
